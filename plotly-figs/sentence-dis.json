institutions regulated by directive eu\",\"there are many different reasons why the system may be giving women lower credit scores\",\"for example many traditional financial models such as generalized linear models glm used to classify risk in insurance and internal ratings based irb approaches to modelling regulatory capital requirements in banking that do not use ai may be as complex and difficult to understand or explain\",\"the supervisory authorities are publishing this dp in response to the aippf final report following their previous work on ai including through the digital

drivers of risk can result in a range of outcomes depending on how the ai system is used within financial services\",\"ai systems used in employment workers management and access to self employment notably for the recruitment and selection of persons for making decisions on promotion and termination and for task allocation monitoring or evaluation of persons in work related contractual relationships should also be classified as high risk since those systems may appreciably impact future career prospects and livelihoods of these persons\",\"increasing societal trust would also benefit all companies in the ai value chainbecause strengthening citizens confidence will contribute to a faster uptake of ai\",\"the consumer duty does not prevent firms from adopting business models with different pricing by groups for instance risk based pricing but firms would need to ensure the price charged is reasonable relative to the expected benefits ie that products and services provide fair value to retail customers including being able to justify the price offered to different groups of customers and considering those with characteristics of vulnerability or protected characteristics under the equality act\",\"such adaptationsshould contribute to societal and consumer trust and thereby promote the roll out ofai\",\"the bank pra and the fca seek to encourage a broad

support consumers with characteristics of vulnerability as well as increasing financial access\",\"an ai model which filters out spam emails for example will present fewer ethical challenges than one which identifies vulnerable children\",\"but risks to competition may also arise where ai is used to implement or facilitate further harmful strategic behaviour such as collusion or creating or exacerbating market features that hinder competition such as barriers to entry or to leverage a dominant position\",\"this can create up to  more cross border digital trade in the single

tasks which previously required human intelligence\",\"the report explores the various barriers challenges and risks related to the use of ai in financial services and potential ways to address them\",\"the promise of this technology is to make financial services and markets more efficient accessible and tailored to consumer needs\",\"those individuals should be accountable for any negative impact on interpretability and the effectiveness of human reviews and only provide sign off if ai systems are in line with the adopted risk management policy\",\"in addition recipients of the service should have information on the main parameters used for determining that specific advertising is to be displayed to them providing meaningful explanations of the logic used to that end including when this is based on profiling\",\"a number of public sector organisations are already successfully using ai for tasks ranging from fraud detection to answering customer queries\",\"as our recent survey indicates ai adoption within financial services is likely to continue to increase due to increased availability of data improvements in computational power and wider availability of ai skills and

format\",\"as regards possible synergies with other appropriate instruments the role of notifying authorities at national level can be performed by national authorities fulfilling similar functions

rules set out in article  of directive ec including those regarding the need to justify measures derogating from the competence of the member state where the service provider is established on certain specified grounds and regarding the notification of such measures do not apply in respect of those orders\",\"it is appropriate that this regulation identify certain areas of consideration for such

providers from adhering to the same standards of due diligence adopting best practices and benefitting from the guidance provided by the commission and the board by participating in the same codes of

group of recipients of the service who are not specifically identified including orders to provide aggregate information required for statistical purposes or evidence based policy making should remain unaffected by the rules of this regulation on the provision of information\",\"since the objective of this regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can rather by reason of

a european coordination mechanism providing for appropriate capacities and facilitating audits of the ai systems with new requirements for documentation traceability and transparency\",\"for example the measures concerning advertising on online platforms complement but do not amend existing rules on consent and the right to object to processing of personal data\",\"in order to ensure the

authority takes in relation to that system\",\"this does not concern monitoring obligations in a specific case and in particular does not affect orders by national authorities in accordance with national legislation in accordance with the conditions established in this regulation\",\"at the same time the provisions of the regulation are not overly prescriptive and leave room for different levels of member state action for elements that do not undermine the objectives of the initiative in particular the internal organisation of the market surveillance system and the uptake of measures to foster innovation\",\"there is a general agreement among stakeholders that harmful yet not or at least not necessarily illegal content should not be defined in the digital services act and should not be subject to removal obligations as this is a delicate area with severe implications for the protection of freedom of expression\",\"member states may designate a national accreditation body referred to in regulation ec no  as a notifying authority\",\"the exemptions from liability established in this regulation should not affect the possibility of injunctions of different kinds against

been drawn up correctlythe identification number of the notified body which is involved in the conformity assessment procedure where applicable has not been affixedwhere the non compliance referred to in paragraph  persists the member state concerned shall take all appropriate measures to restrict or prohibit the high risk ai system being made available on the market or ensure that it is recalled or withdrawn from the market\",\"the new regulation prohibits general monitoring obligations as they could disproportionately limit users freedom of expression and freedom to receive information and could burden service providers excessively and thus unduly interfere with their freedom to conduct a business\",\"additionally the board would establish two standing sub groups to provide a platform for cooperation and exchange among market surveillance authorities and notifying authorities on issues related respectively to market surveillance and notified bodies\",\"member states should ensure that violations of the obligations laid down in this regulation can be sanctioned in a manner that is effective proportionate and dissuasive taking into account the nature gravity recurrence and

enhance the administrative cooperation mechanisms for authorities to resolve cross border issues through a digital clearing house facilitating information flows\",\"you should use the expertise and active cooperation of all your team members to address them\",\"the market surveillance authority shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly\",\"with regard to the horizontal framework of the liability exemption for providers of intermediary services this regulation deletes articles   in the e commerce directive and reproduces them in the regulation maintaining the liability exemptions of such providers as interpreted by the court of justice of the european union\",\"paragraph  is without prejudice to union or member states legislation excluding processing for other purposes than those explicitly mentioned in that legislation\",\"if your chosen service is not designed to easily comply with these rights this does not remove or change those obligations\",\"the responsible minister by order may require production of these records\",\"chapter iv contains the provisions concerning the implementation and enforcement of this regulation\",\"providers of intermediary services should not be subject to a monitoring obligation with respect to obligations of a general nature\",\"orders to act against illegal content and to provide information are subject to the rules safeguarding the competence of the member state where the service provider addressed is established and laying down possible derogations from that competence in certain cases set out in article  of directive ec only if the conditions of that article are met\",\"the obligation to put in place notice and action mechanisms should apply for instance to file storage and sharing services web hosting services advertising servers and paste bins in as far as they qualify as providers of hosting services covered by this regulation\",\"in view of the different nature of the activities of mere conduit caching and hosting and the different position and abilities of the providers of the services in question it is necessary to distinguish the rules applicable to those activities in so far as under this regulation they are subject to different requirements and conditions and their scope differs as interpreted by the court of justice of the european union\",\"this approach is fully reflected in the interplay between this regulation and the machinery regulation\",\"where necessary for their mandate national public authorities or bodies which supervise the application of union law protecting fundamental rights including equality bodies should also have access to any documentation created under this regulation\",\"in addition member states should lay down and notify to the commission the rules on penalties including administrative fines and ensure that they are properly and effectively implemented by the date of application of this regulation\",\"the declaration shall contain all the information required for identification of the union harmonisation legislation to which the declaration relates\",\"the exemption of microand small enterprises from those additional obligations should

for communication with operators\",\"where a provider of intermediary services fails to appoint a legal representative in accordance with article  all member states shall have jurisdiction for the purposes of chapters iii and iv\",\"in order to create legal certainty and not to discourage activities aimed at detecting identifying and acting against illegal content that providers of intermediary services may undertake on a voluntary basis it should be clarified that the mere fact that providers undertake such activities does not lead to the unavailability of the exemptions from liability set out in this regulation provided those activities are carried out in good faith and in a diligent manner\",\"in particular risk mitigation measures concerning specific types of illegal content should be explored via selfand co regulatory agreements\",\"member states shall ensure that the maximum amount of penalties imposed for a failure to comply with the obligations laid down in this regulation shall not exceed   of the annual income or turnover of the provider of intermediary services concerned\",\"as these provisions are voluntary they are not supported by formal regulatory oversight that said they should be understood in the broader context of government pressure to strengthen industry self discipline\",\"the envisaged policy measures in this legislative proposal will substantially improve this situation by providing a modern future proof governance framework effectively safeguarding the rights and legitimate interests of all parties involved most of all union citizens\",\"the applicability of the requirements of this regulation should thus not affect the specific logic methodology or general structure of conformity assessment under the relevant specific new legislative framework legislation\",\"in order to address those public policy concerns it is therefore necessary to provide for a common system of enhanced supervision and enforcement at union level\",\"to this objective member states should develop initiatives which are targeted at those operators including on awareness raising and information communication\",\"they remain governed by the applicablenational law and where harmonised by applicable union law\",\"in addition it is appropriate to clarify that the mere fact that those providers take measures in good faith to comply with the requirements of union law including those set out in this regulation as regards the implementation of their terms and conditions should not lead to the unavailability of those exemptions from liability\",\"it does not constitute binding guidance for the public or federal agencies and therefore does not require compliance with the principles described herein\",\"at the national level member states will have to designate one or more national competent authorities and among them the national supervisory authority for the purpose of supervising the application and implementation of the regulation\",\"in this context providers should also be required to have a system in place to report to the relevant authorities any serious incidents or any breaches to national and union law protecting fundamental rights resulting from the use of their ai systems\",\"in particular penalties should take into account whether the provider of intermediary services concerned systematically or recurrently fails to comply with its obligations stemming from this regulation as well as where relevant whether the provider is active in several member states\",\"the illegal nature of such content products or services is not defined in this regulation but results from union law or from national law in accordance with union law\",\"providers of intermediary services that are established in a third country that offer services in the union should designate a sufficiently mandated legal representative in the union and provide information relating to their legal representatives so as to allow for the effective oversight and where necessary enforcement of this regulation in relation to those providers\",\"specifically this regulation should apply to providers of intermediary services and in particular intermediary services consisting of services known as mere conduit caching and hosting services given that the exponential growth of the use made of those services mainly for legitimate and socially beneficial purposes of all kinds has also increased their role in the intermediation and spread of unlawful or otherwise harmful information and activities\",\"they also advocate for public oversight at eu and national level and cooperation between competent authorities across jurisdictions in enforcing the law especially when addressing cross border matters\",\"this regulation shall apply to intermediary services provided to recipients of the service that have their place of establishment or residence in the union irrespective of the place of establishment of the providers of those services\",\"this regulation is without prejudice to the rules laid down by the followingdirective ecdirective ecunion law on copyright and related rightsregulation eu\",\"nothing in this regulation should be construed as an imposition of a general monitoring obligation or active fact finding obligation or as a general obligation for providers to take proactive measures to relation to illegal content\",\"the penalties would be designed in a proportionate manner to the objective of encouraging compliance including with respect to the relative size of firms\",\"given that the orders in question relate to specific items of illegal content and information respectively where they are addressed to providers of intermediary services established in another member state they do not in principle restrict those providers freedom to provide their services across borders\",\"adoption of these principles may not meet the requirements of existing statutes regulations policies or international instruments or the requirements of the federal agencies that enforce them\",\"however the rules of this regulation apply in respect of issues that are not or not fully addressed by those other acts as well as issues on which those other acts leave member states the possibility of adopting certain measures at national level\",\"nevertheless to ensure an effective harmonisation across the union and avoid legal fragmentation it is necessary to include those rules in a regulation\",\"notified bodies shall have sufficient internal competences to be able to effectively evaluate the tasks conducted by external parties on their behalf\",\"while data protection and ai ethics overlap this guidance does not provide generic ethical or design principles for your use of ai\",\"any disclosure of information will be carried out in compliance with relevant legislation in the field including directive  on the protection of undisclosed know how and business information trade secrets against their unlawful acquisition use and disclosure\",\"state authorities are also covered by the provisions of the ai actas subjects of the obligations prescribed therein\",\"the list of prohibited practices in title ii comprises all those ai systems whose use is considered unacceptable as contravening union values for instance by violating fundamental rights\",\"in the event of restriction suspension or withdrawal of notification or where the notified body has ceased its activity the notifying authority shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the files of that notified body are either taken over by another notified body or kept available for the responsible notifying authorities at their request\",\"the concept of dissemination to the public as used in this regulation should entail the making available of information to a potentially unlimited number of persons that is making the information easily accessible to users in general without further action by the recipient of the service providing the information being required irrespective of whether those persons actually access the information in question\",\"both cac regulations predominantly focus on the service provider and in some cases the user\",\"ethical review and use prohibitions\",\"this shall take place under the direct supervision and guidance by the competent authorities with a view to ensuring compliance with the requirements of this regulation and where relevant other union and member states legislation supervised within the sandbox\",\"this regulation should also apply to union institutions offices bodies and agencies when acting as a provider or user of an ai system\",\"in this regard it is immaterial whether the illegality of the information or activity results from union law or from national law that is consistent with union law and what the precise nature or subject matter is of the law in question\",\"certain practices may also breach the principles or the fca consumer duty for instance where a firm did not present the way they would use customer data in a way that was clear fair and not misleading and used their data in ways to which they had not consented and which was potentially to their detriment\",\"article orders to provide informationproviders of intermediary services shall upon receipt of an order to provide a specific item of information about one or more specific individual recipients of the service issued by the relevant national judicial or administrative authorities on the basis of the applicable union or national law in conformity with union law inform without undue delay the authority of issuing the order of its receipt and the effect given to the order\",\"article no general monitoring or active fact finding obligationsno general obligation to monitor the information which providers of intermediary services transmit or store nor actively to seek facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity shall be imposed on those providers\",\"by  months after the entering into force of this regulation each member state shall identify the public authorities or bodies referred to in paragraph  and make a list publicly available on the website of the national supervisory authority\",\"where the market surveillance authority considers that non compliance is not restricted to its national territory it shall inform the commission and the other member states of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which it has required the operator to take\",\"however the consumer duty as a whole is broader than the existing rules in prod satisfying the prod rules is unlikely to mean a firm meets all aspects of the consumer duty\",\"it does not supersede modify or direct an interpretation of any existing statute regulation policy or international instrument\",\"in the absence of a general requirement for providers of intermediary services to ensure a physical presence within the territory of one of the member states there is a need to ensure clarity under which member states jurisdiction those providers fall for the purposes of enforcing the rules laid down in chapters iii and iv by the national competent authorities\",\"the consumer duty also includes cross cutting rules requiring firms to act in good faith towards retail customers avoid causing foreseeable harm to retail customers and enable and support retail customers to pursue their financial objectives\",\"those depend on the values at play in the relevant context and should be resolved in a manner that is both transparent and appropriately justifiable\",\"those restrictions are proportionate and limited to the minimum necessary to prevent and mitigate serious safety risks and likely infringements of fundamental rights\",\"the regulation sets also a limitation period for the imposition of penalties article  and for their enforcement article\",\"this guidance is not a statutory code\",\"in respect of providers that do not have an establishment in the union but that offer services in the union and therefore fall within the scope of this regulation the member state where those providers appointed their legal representative should have jurisdiction considering the function of legal representatives under this regulation\",\"any valid document related to existing designations of the applicant notified body under any other union harmonisation legislation shall be added\",\"the standards could distinguish between different types of illegal content or different types of intermediary services as appropriate\",\"therefore prior to making their ai systems available in the union where an importer cannot be identified providers established outside the union shall by written mandate appoint an

of the service in their terms and conditions\",\"moreover member states are in principle not precluded from merging functions within an existing authority in accordance with union law\",\"individual employees would not be expected to be responsible for obligations associated with the business as a whole\",\"this regulation should apply only to intermediary services and not affect requirements set out in union or national law relating to products or services intermediated through intermediary services including in situations where the intermediary service constitutes an integral part of another service which is not an intermediary service as specified in the case law of the court of justice of the european union\",\"in particular that concept should be understood to refer to information irrespective of its form that under the applicable law is either itself illegal such as illegal hate speech or terrorist content and unlawful discriminatory content or that relates to activities that are illegal such as the sharing of images depicting child sexual abuse unlawful non consensual sharing of private images online stalking the sale of non compliant or counterfeit products the non

acts\",\"the ce marking referred to in paragraph  of this article shall be subject to the general principles set out in article  of regulation ec no\",\"this proposed regulation is without prejudice to the e commerce directive and builds on the provisions laid down therein notably on the internal market principle set out in article\",\"section  includes the common provisions on enforcement\",\"to prevent the circumvention of this regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the union this regulation should also apply to providers and users of ai systems that are established in a third country to the extent the output produced by those systems is used in the union\",\"furthermore where it is necessary to involve information society services providers including providers of intermediary services any requests or orders for such involvement should as a general rule be directed to the actor that has the technical and operational ability to act against specific items of illegal content so as to prevent and minimise any possible negative effects for the availability and accessibility of information that is not illegal content\",\"in particular third parties potentially affected should be afforded the opportunity to be heard and such orders should only be issued when powers to take such measures as provided by other acts of union law or by national law for instance to protect collective interests of consumers to ensure the prompt removal of web pages containing or disseminating child pornography or to disable access to services are being used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right are not reasonably available\",\"this regulation shall not apply to any service that is not an intermediary service or to any requirements imposed in respect of such a service irrespective of whether the service is provided through the use of an intermediary service\",\"companies use surveillance software to track employee

the request issuance and exercise of as well as supervision relating to the authorisations referred to in paragraph\",\"adverse differentiation could be considered justified if it is unavoidable in the context of real world factors affecting a decision or recommendationfor example individual income often correlates with the prohibited grounds such as race and gender but income is also relevant to decisions or recommendations related to credit\",\"at the same time this proposal does not create or harmonise the duties of care or the liabilityof various entities whose activity is regulated under those legal acts and therefore does notcreate new liability claims or affect the exemptions from liability under those other legal acts\",\"providers of intermediary services shall make public the information necessary to easily identify and communicate with their single points of contact\",\"a provider of intermediary services that deliberately collaborates with a recipient of the services in order to undertake illegal activities does not provide its service neutrally and should therefore not be able to benefit from the exemptions from liability provided for in this regulation\",\"the approximation of national regulatory measures at union level concerning the requirements for providers of intermediary services is necessary in order to avoid and put an end to fragmentation of the internal market and to ensure legal certainty thus reducing uncertainty for developers and fostering interoperability\",\"in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out inthat article this directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achievethat objective\",\"in line with this objective the proposal aims to ensure harmonised conditions for innovative cross border services to develop in the union by addressing and preventing the emergence of obstacles to such economic activity resulting from differences in the way national laws develop taking into account that several member states have legislated or intend to legislate on issues such as the removal of illegal content online diligence notice and action procedures and transparency\",\"member states shall ensure that where the disclosure of a trade secret or allegedtrade secret which the court has identified as confidential within the meaning ofarticle  of directive eu  is ordered national courts are

processing of personal data assigning the roles of controller and processor can become complex for instance when some of the processing happens in the cloud\",\"for instance ai systems used in process optimisation makeprocesses less wasteful eg\",\"the feedback loopfootnote between the data and ai algorithm could exacerbate these effects\",\"codes of conduct may be drawn up by individual providers of ai systems or by organisations representing them or by both including with the involvement of users and any interested stakeholders and their representative organisations\",\"these considerations make the fine tuning of ai systems relevant to both data scientists and delivery leads\",\"for example how a human operator or user is notified when a potential or actual adverse outcome caused by an ai system is detected\",\"produce a positive social impact by using ai to provide solutions for some of the worlds most challenging social problems\",\"these actors further help to incorporate context specific norms and values in system design and evaluate end user experiences  in conjunction with ai systems\",\"the interdependencies between these activities and among the relevant ai actors can make it difficult to reliably anticipate impacts of ai systems\",\"see the section how should we understand controllerprocessor relationships in ai for more details\",\"ai offers a multitude of benefits for canadians among which areenabling advances in healthcare such as cancer screenings and improving at home healthcare services improving agriculture precision harvesting and improving energy supply chain efficiency introducing new smart products and personalized servicesincreasing the capabilities of language processing technologies including translation and text to speech andenhancing citizens abilities to find and process information\",\"codes of conduct may cover one or more ai systems taking into account the similarity of the intended purpose of the relevant systems\",\"the core messages gleaned from these discussions include that ai has transformative potential to improve americans lives and that preventing the harms of these technologies is both necessary and achievable\",\"the main ways ai systems can cause involuntary harm are misuse systems are used for purposes other than those for which they were designed and intended\",\"unlike a human

and the member states in the artificial intelligence field as well as to increase the transparency towards the public providers of high risk ai systems other than those related to products falling within the scope of relevant existing union harmonisation legislation should be required to register their high risk ai system in a eu database to be established and managed by the commission\",\"the notion of ai system should be clearly defined to ensure legal certainty while providing the flexibility to accommodate future technological developments\",\"the ai system to be deployed is demonstrated to be safe its residual negative risk does not exceed the risk tolerance and it can fail safely particularly if made to operate beyond its knowledge limits\",\"providers of high risk ai

of their intended purpose they pose a high risk of harm to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons taking into account both the severity of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a number of specifically pre defined areas specified in the regulation\",\"consistently with the objectives of union harmonisation legislation to facilitate the free movement of products in the internal market and to ensure that only safe and otherwise compliant products find their way into the market it is important that the safety risks that may be generated by a product as a whole due to its digital components including ai systems are duly prevented and mitigated\",\"this is different from the eus draft ai act where a full chapter of the future regulation is currently devoted to outlining the classification of high risk systems\",\"ai systems presenting a risk shall be understood as a product presenting a risk defined in article  point  of regulation

reason to consider that a high risk ai system is not in conformity with the requirements set out in chapter  of this title it shall not make the high risk ai system available on the market until that system has been brought into conformity with those requirements\",\"the proposal builds on existing legal frameworks and is proportionate and necessary to achieve its objectives since it follows a risk based approach and imposes regulatory burdens only when an ai system is likely to pose high risks to fundamental rights and safety\",\"the authorisation referred to in paragraph  shall be issued only if the market surveillance authority concludes that the high risk ai system complies with the requirements of chapter  of this title\",\"specific objective no to set requirements specific to ai systems and obligations on all value chain participants in order to ensure that ai systems placed on the market and used are safe and respect existing law on fundamental rights and union valuesspecific objective no to ensure legal certainty to facilitate investment and innovation in ai by making it clear what essential requirements obligations as well as conformity and compliance procedures must be followed to place or use an ai system in the union marketspecific objective no to enhance governance and effective enforcement of existing law on fundamental rights and safety requirements applicable to ai systems by providing new powers resources and clear rules for relevant authorities on conformity assessment and expost monitoring procedures and the division of governance and supervision tasks between national and eu levelsspecific objective no to facilitate the development of a single market for lawful safe and trustworthy ai applications and prevent market fragmentation by taking eu action to set minimum requirement for ai systems to be placed and used in the union market in compliance with existing law on fundamental rights and safety\",\"before placing on the market or putting into service a high risk ai system referred to in article  the provider or where applicable the authorised representative shall register that system in the eu database referred to in article\",\"it would require specific steps including the identification and analysis of the known and foreseeable risks associated with each high risk ai system and the estimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge when the high risk ai system is used in accordance with its intended purpose and under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse\",\"in order to introduce a proportionate and effective set of binding rules for ai systems a clearly defined risk based approach should be followed\",\"providers shall establish and document a post market monitoring system in a manner that is proportionate to the nature of the artificial intelligence technologies and the risks of the high risk ai system\",\"however a new compliance and enforcement system will be established for stand alone high risk ai systems detailed in annex iii\",\"the latest draft also includes requirements for general ai systems that could be used for high risk applications\",\"this registration

natural persons involved in the verification of the results as referred to in article\",\"to ensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks suitable measures should therefore be taken by the providers of high risk ai systems also taking into account as appropriate the underlying ict infrastructure\",\"the fact that an ai system is classified as high risk under this regulation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the system is necessarily lawful under other acts of union law or under national law compatible with union law such as on the protection of personal data on the use of polygraphs and similar tools or other systems to detect the emotional state of natural persons\",\"having information on how high risk ai systems have been developed and how they perform

systems that create a high risk to the health and safety or fundamental rights of natural persons\",\"for high risk ai systems the requirements of high quality data documentation and traceability transparency human oversight accuracy and robustness are strictly necessary to mitigate the risks to fundamental rights and safety posed by ai and that are not covered by other existing legal frameworks\",\"title ix creates a framework for the creation of codes of conduct which aim to encourage providers of non high risk ai systems to apply voluntarily the mandatory requirements for high risk ai systems as laid out in title iii\",\"article  would require that technical documentation is drawn up before a high risk system is put on the market or into service and that such documentation is kept up to date\",\"ai systems used in education or vocational training notably for determining access or assigning persons to educational and vocational training institutions or to evaluate persons on tests as part of or as a precondition for their education should be considered high risk since they may determine the educational and professional course of a persons life and therefore affect their ability to secure their livelihood\",\"where the market surveillance authority of a member state has sufficient reasons to consider that an ai system presents a risk as referred to in paragraph  they shall carry out an evaluation of the ai system concerned in respect of its compliance with all the requirements and obligations laid down in this regulation\",\"where in demonstrating the compliance of a high risk ai system with the requirements set out in chapter  of this title the provider has not applied or has applied only in part harmonised standards referred to in article  or

managing the risk of discriminatory outcomes in ml systems will depend on the particular domain and context you are operating in\",\"these include the importance of minimising and mitigating social bias and subsequent discrimination within machine learning research and clearly communicating these biases and the limitations of our research\",\"carefully reviewing the fast track principles helps you ensure your project is fair and prevent bias or discrimination\",\"systems in which harmful biases are mitigated are not necessarily fair\",\"standards of fairness can be complex and difficult to define because perceptions of fairness differ among cultures and may shift depending on application\",\"there is a risk that the use of ai could be associated with discriminatory decisions\",\"demonstrate that the system protects against algorithmic discriminationindependent evaluation\",\"this is also true for dpos and senior staff in oversight functions as they will be expected to provide ongoing advice and guidance on the appropriateness of any measures and safeguards put in place to mitigate discrimination risk\",\"such data should be sufficiently robust to identify and help to mitigate biases and potential harms\",\"similarly re training a discriminatory model with data from a more diverse population to reduce its discriminatory effects does not involve directly making decisions about individuals and is therefore not classed as a decision with legal or similarly significant effect\",\"with proper controls ai systems can mitigate and manage inequitable outcomes\",\"if adequate mitigation of the disparity is not possible then the use of the automated system should be reconsidered\",\"were there any limitations or biases in the training data that may have affected the results\",\"the model was found to use race directly as a predictor and also shown to have large disparities by race black students were as many as four times as likely

disfavoring people based on their race color ethnicity sex including pregnancy childbirth and related medical conditions gender identity intersex status and sexual orientation religion age national origin disability veteran status genetic information or any other classification protected by law\",\"the special publication describes the stakes and challenges of bias in artificial intelligence and provides examples of how and why it can chip away at public trust identifies three categories of bias in ai  systemic statistical and human  and describes how and where they contribute to harms and describes three broad challenges for mitigating bias  datasets testing and evaluation and human factors  and introduces preliminary guidance for addressing them\",\"disparity assessment\",\"experience of working to minimise bias from data\",\"this threshold is proportionate to the risks brought by the reach of the platforms in the union where the unions population changes by a certain percentage the commission will adjust the number of recipients considered for the threshold so that it consistently corresponds to   of the unions population\",\"in addition healthcare clinical algorithms that are used by physicians to guide clinical decisions may include sociodemographic variables that adjust or correct the algorithms output on the basis of a patients race or ethnicity which can lead to race based health inequities\",\"if the men are over represented in the training data the model will pay more attention to the statistical relationships that predict repayment rates for men and less to statistical patterns that predict repayment rates for women which might be different\",\"non profits and companies have developed best practices for audits and impact assessments to help identify potential algorithmic discrimination and provide transparency to the public in the mitigation of such biases\",\"to do this you should use only fair and equitable datasets data fairness\",\"the aida specifies that biased output means content that is generated or a decision recommendation or prediction that is made by an ai system and that adversely differentiates in relation to an individual on one or more of the prohibited grounds of discrimination set out in the canadian human rights act or on a combination of such prohibited grounds however biased output will not include content or a decision recommendation or prediction the purpose and effect of which are to prevent disadvantages that are likely to be suffered by or to eliminate or reduce disadvantages that are suffered by any

mitigate its discriminatory impact\",\"this will help you to demonstrate that your processing is fair necessary proportionate adequate relevant and limited\",\"have you scrutinised your training data for potential biases and considered the potential for your own conscious or sub conscious biases to be reflected in the data\",\"for example if discriminatory outcomes in the model are driven by a relative lack of data about a statistically small minority of the population then statistical accuracy of the model could be increased by collecting more data about them whilst also equalising the proportions of correct predictions\",\"for example if you were using an ai system to assist with sorting job applicants rather than attempting to create a model which ignores a persons disability it may be more effective to include their disability status in order to ensure the system does not indirectly discriminate against them\",\"warehousing employers in california that use quota systems

historical patterns of discrimination\",\"if your ai system processes social or demographic data you should design it to meet a minimum level of discriminatory non harm\",\"this would raise concerns about the systems statistical accuracy especially if the system is used to make legal or similarly significant decisions about individuals\",\"improving the statistical accuracy of your ai systems outputs is one of your considerations to ensure compliance with the fairness principle\",\"furthermore the proposal complements existing union law on non discrimination with specific requirements that

characteristics from proxy data contained in the job application despite the designer never intending it to\",\"rather than trying to make a model fair by ignoring protected characteristics when making a prediction some approaches directly include such characteristics when making a classification to ensure members of potentially disadvantaged groups are protected\",\"throughout the recruitment process and in the evaluation promotion or retention of persons in work related contractual relationships such systems may perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination for example against women certain age groups persons with disabilities or persons of certain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation\",\"implement the system in an unbiased way implementation fairness\",\"for example to reduce the potential for discrimination you might modify a credit risk model so that the proportion of positive predictions between people with different protected characteristics eg men and women are equalised\",\"for example the equal employment opportunity commission and the department of justice have provided guidance on how employers use of software that relies on algorithmic decision making may violate existing requirements under title  of the americans with disabilities act ada and how employment discrimination law can be enforced to tackle discriminatory practices by employers\",\"demonstrating that an ai system is not unlawfully discriminatory under the ea is a complex task but it is separate and additional to your obligations relating to discrimination under data protection law\",\"fairness are the models trained and tested on relevant accurate and generalisable datasets and is the ai system deployed by users trained to implement them responsibly and without bias\",\"these signature matching systems are less likely to work correctly for some voters including voters with mental or physical disabilities voters with shorter or hyphenated names and voters who have changed their name\",\"while discrimination is a broader problem that cannot realistically be fixed through technology various approaches exist which aim to mitigate ai driven discrimination\",\"monitoring and disparity assessment should be performed by the entity deploying or using the automated system to examine whether the system has led to algorithmic discrimination when deployed\",\"for example if the system amplifies the underlying correlation or produces unfair results for specific individuals based on the prohibited grounds this would not be considered justified\",\"detecting bias within machine learning studies can be very difficult and understanding and limiting the effects of bias once it is identified can be a complex process\",\"the proposal is also fully consistent and further supports equality strategies adopted by the commission in the context of the union of equality\",\"the equal employment opportunity commission and the department of justice have clearly laid out how employers use of ai and other automated systems can result in discrimination against job applicants and employees with disabilities\",\"if it produces a false negative a qualified candidate will miss an employment opportunity and the organisation will miss a good candidate\",\"while automated systems have the capacity to drive extraordinary advances and innovations algorithmic discrimination protections should be built into their design deployment and ongoing use\",\"in some cases mitigation or elimination of the disparity may be required by law\",\"meeting these standards may require instituting mitigation procedures and other protective measures to address algorithmic discrimination avoid meaningful harm and achieve equity goals\",\"demographic data collected for disparity assessment should be separated from data used for the automated system and privacy protections should be instituted in some cases it may make sense to perform such assessment using a data sample\",\"it should also include expectations about reporting described throughout this framework such as the algorithmic impact assessments described as part of algorithmic discrimination protections\",\"will the outcome of the research affect groups or individuals either positively or negatively\",\"however this may not eradicate the bias completely and can in some instances worsen the problem as correlated attributes still existent in the data may still reflect the bias you are trying to erase\",\"as ai systems learn from data which may be unbalanced andor reflect discrimination they may produce outputs which have discriminatory effects on people based on their gender race age health religion disability sexual orientation or other characteristics\",\"similar to prejudicial bias is observer bias which relates to the conscious and unconscious prejudices or judgements which a researcher may bring to their data\",\"these biases can also influence downstream decisions by end users decision makers and policy makers and may lead to negative impacts\",\"in a labour market where certain religious groups have been historically excluded from particular professions a cv scoring system may unfairly under rate candidates on the basis of those proxies\",\"the social score obtained from such ai systems may lead to the detrimental or unfavourable treatment of natural persons or whole groups thereof in social contexts which are unrelated to the context in which the data was originally generated or collected or to a detrimental treatment that is disproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their social behaviour\",\"for example systems in which predictions are somewhat balanced across demographic groups may still be inaccessible to individuals with disabilities or affected by the digital divide or may exacerbate existing disparities or systemic biases\",\"the demographics of the assessed groups should be as inclusive as possible of race color ethnicity sex including pregnancy childbirth and related medical conditions gender identity intersex status and sexual orientation religion age national origin disability veteran status genetic information or any other classification protected by law\",\"data included should be carefully limited to avoid algorithmic discrimination resulting from eg use of community characteristics social network analysis or group based inferences\",\"other measures involve comparing how the ai system distributes positive or negative outcomes or errors between protected groups\",\"additionally harmful bias and other data quality issues can affect ai system trustworthiness which could lead to negative impacts\",\"the department of justice is working to reduce these disparities and has publicly released a report detailing its review of the tool\",\"have you considered the potential for bias which could arise from any of your data\",\"bias exists in many forms and can become ingrained in the automated systems that help make decisions about our lives\",\"for example if in the past loan applications from women were rejected more frequently than those from men due to prejudice then any model based on such training data is likely to reproduce the same pattern of discrimination\",\"this field is often referred to as algorithmic fairness\",\"not including disability status as an input to the automated decision could mean the system is more likely to indirectly discriminate against people with a disability because it will not factor in the effect of their condition on other features used to make a prediction\",\"data may reflect historical biases in society for instance where certain groups have been less able to access credit\",\"in practice there may not always be a tension between statistical accuracy and avoiding discrimination\",\"bias related to protected characteristics such as race or sex could arise inadvertently during model development\",\"as a result drivers were incorrectly ineligible to receive a bonus\",\"when assessing proportionality you need to weigh up your interests in using ai against the risks it may pose to the rights and freedoms of individuals\",\"a hiring tool that learned the features of a companys employees predominantly men rejected women applicants for spurious and discriminatory reasons resumes with the word womens such as womens chess club captain were penalized in the candidate ranking\",\"potential bias and discrimination risk discriminatory decisions made through using ai systems could be a breach of the equality act  equality act which protects individuals from discrimination on the basis of nine protected characteristicsfootnote the ehrc is the body with primary responsibility for upholding equality and human rights laws in the uk\",\"unfortunately this also includes detecting patterns of discrimination using complex combinations of features which might be correlated with protected characteristics in non obvious ways\",\"for instance the aaa would direct the federal trade commission ftc to require covered entities that sell or use automated decision systems and augmented critical decision processes to complete impact assessments including accuracy fairness bias and discrimination\",\"in many cases attributes that are highly correlated with demographic features known as proxies can contribute to algorithmic discrimination\",\"third the uk gdpr specifically notes that processing personal data for profiling and automated decision making may give rise to discrimination and that you should use appropriate technical and organisational measures to prevent this\",\"similarly the ftc has published guidance on how various acts should be interpreted in light of ai systems the ftc act section  prohibits unfair or deceptive practices including the sale or use of  for example  racially biassed algorithms the fair credit reporting act may be enforced when an algorithm is used to deny people employment housing credit insurance or other benefits and the equal credit opportunity act makes it illegal for a company to use a biassed algorithm that results in credit discrimination on the basis of race colour religion national origin sex marital status age or because a person receives public assistance\",\"the proposal is without prejudice to the application of union competition law\",\"under the aida biased output occurs when there is unjustified and adverse differential impact based on any of prohibited grounds for discrimination in the canadian human rights act\",\"in this case the ai system puts members of a certain group women at a disadvantage and so would appear to be discriminatory\",\"you could then use this dataset to test how the system would perform with each protected group and also potentially to re train the model to avoid discriminatory effects\",\"the proportion of different genders in the training data may not be balanced\",\"is left out of the training data exclusion bias may occur\",\"computer scientists and others have been developing different mathematical techniques to measure how ml models treat individuals from different groups in potentially discriminatory ways and reduce them\",\"specific groups or persons may be vulnerable or disadvantaged in their use of online services because of their gender race or ethnic origin religion or belief disability age or sexual orientation\",\"the federal government is working to combat discrimination in mortgage lending\",\"similarly a data protection impact assessment should contain measures to address and mitigate those risks which include the risk of discrimination\",\"for examplemechanisms such as human rights commissions provide for redress in cases of discrimination however individuals subject to ai bias may never be aware that it has occurredgiven the wide range of uses of ai systems throughout the economy many sensitive use cases do not fall under existing sectoral regulators andthere is a need for minimum standards as well as greater coordination and expertise to ensure consistent protections for canadians across use contexts\",\"finally if the protected characteristics you are using to assess and improve potentially discriminatory ai were originally processed for a different purpose you should consider whether your new purpose is compatible with the original purpose\",\"you still need to consider the broader questions of lawfulness fairness and the risks the processing poses as a whole\",\"as explained in the section on what do we need to do about statistical accuracy the fairness principle means that your ai system needs to be sufficiently statistically accurate for your purposes\",\"algorithms used in hiring and credit decisions have been found to reflect and reproduce existing unwanted inequities or embed new harmful bias and discrimination\",\"proactive testing should be performed to identify proxies by testing for correlation between demographic information and attributes in any data used as part of system design development or use\",\"other causes of potentially discriminatory ai systems include prejudices or bias in the way variables are measured labelled or aggregated\",\"inappropriately defined objectives eg where the best candidate for a job embeds assumptions about gender race or other characteristics\",\"for example an ai system used to predict loan repayment rates is likely to breach the fairness principle if it makes predictions which frequently turn out to be incorrect\",\"to do this you shoulduse only fair and equitable datasets data fairness\",\"depending on the specific circumstances such algorithmic discrimination may violate legal protections\",\"this provision can be used to identify or keep under review the existence or absence of equality of opportunity or treatment between certain protected groups with a view to enabling such equality to be promoted or maintained\",\"the national science foundations program on fairness in artificial intelligence also includes a specific interest in research foundations for explainable ai\",\"alongside this a lack of diverse input could mean certain groups are disadvantaged as the ai model may not cater for a diverse set of needs\",\"however these may also include patterns that reflect discrimination\",\"such practices are particularly harmful and should be prohibited because they contradict union values of respect for human dignity freedom equality democracy and the rule of law and union fundamental rights including the right to non discrimination data protection and privacy and the rights of the child\",\"however some uses of ai systems may pose risks of causing harm to historically marginalized communities on a large scale if not properly assessed for bias\",\"in order to do this the researcher assigns racial labels to an existing dataset of faces that the system will be tested on thereby processing special category data\",\"this could lead to the preemptive blocking of social media comments such as im gay a related company with this bias concern has made their data public to encourage researchers to help address the issue and has released reports identifying and measuring this problem as well as detailing attempts to address it\",\"you should undertake robust testing of any anti discrimination measures and should monitor your ml systems performance on an ongoing basis\",\"an explanation of any relevant variation or margins of error in the

that your ai systems are sufficiently statistically accurate to ensure that the processing of personal data complies with the fairness principle\",\"large employers have developed best practices to scrutinize the data and models used for hiring\",\"where possible the algorithms and data sets should be tested and validated to mitigate any possible biases and systems should be systematically monitored to ensure that biases do not occur as the systems continue to learn\",\"in some cases ai may actually provide an opportunity to uncover and address existing discrimination in traditional decision making processes and allow you to address any underlying discriminatory practices\",\"under certain conditions such as data sparsity privacyenhancing techniques can result in a loss in accuracy affecting decisions about fairness and other values in certain domains\",\"an analysis of well known facial recognition systems showed evidence of bias against women and people of color\",\"when a disparity assessment identifies a disparity against an assessed group it may be appropriate to take steps to mitigate or eliminate the disparity\",\"these issues will apply to any population under represented in the training data\",\"however in that case you would face a different choice between collecting more data on the minority population in the interests of reducing the

then looking to external oversight canada is playing a key role in the modernization of its regulatory system\",\"to develop the comparative framework we began with a set of draft categories related to key features of ai regulatory policy\",\"below the level of cross cutting regulation sector specific regulators are working on frameworks for ai use\",\"chinas approach to ai regulatory policy is also not laid out in a single regulatory document with several government organisations publishing relevant documents\",\"for instance the supervisory authorities would wish to avoid introducing unnecessarily complex or costly rules that can act as a barrier to entry especially for non systemic firms or unintentionally favour larger firms with more resource to manage compliance with complex rulebooks\",\"similarly the uk intends to rely largely on the existing powers of regulators to regulate ai systems rather than establishing a new monitoring body for ai regulation\",\"the purpose of this project is to fill the gap between these two approaches by developing an accessible comparative framework that captures the key similarities and differences in governments approaches to regulatory policy for governing ai we use the term regulatory policy in line with the oecds definition of the use of regulations laws and other instruments to deliver better economic and social outcomes regulatory policy as understood here includes both hard and soft law initiatives which aim to create rules or guidance for designing developing andor deploying ai\",\"while there appears to be some thematic overlaps eg on data quality most notably the various regulations differ in focus and scope\",\"while domestic and international governance initiatives are still nascent distinct approaches to regulatory policy appear to be emerging in different jurisdictions\",\"similar to the eu canada put forward an overarching regulatory mechanism to guide its approach to ai regulation that however bifurcates into the proposed aida for the private sector and the adopted directive on automated decision making for the public sector\",\"however we think firms deploying ai systems need to have a sufficiently strong set of oversight and governance arrangements that make effective use of humans in the decision making loop and review the accuracy of those arrangements\",\"we plan for the project  of which this report is the first output  to provide a comparison of numerous governments approaches to ai regulatory policy\",\"we filtered ai governance documents for relevance based on the following criteria inclusion criteria hard or soft law initiatives that are designed to govern ai technologies which have been drafted or published by a national levelgovernment institution including hard law introduced by national level government institutions inclusiveof both primary and secondary legislation eg\",\"another hard law policy introduced recently by the cac is the draft provisions on the administration of deep synthesis internet information services  which seek to regulate generative algorithms such as those that create deepfakes\",\"these crimes could be investigated by law enforcement and prosecuted at the discretion of public prosecution service of canadathe path aheadthe aida is one of the first national regulatory frameworks for ai to be proposed\",\"however the current scope of mrm regulation in the uk is very limited with only principles and regulation in place for the use of models in specific areas or tasks eg internal capital models or stress testing models\",\"in the past few years early mover governments have made significant progress in developing their approaches to ai regulatory policy\",\"the questions fall under three main categoriessupervisory authorities objectives and remits exploring the best approach to defining andor scoping the characteristics of ai for the purposes of legal requirements and guidance\",\"the specific measures required by regulation would be developed through extensive consultation and would be based on international standards and best practices in order to avoid undue impacts on innovation\",\"in order to minimise the risks to implementation resulting from lack of knowledge and expertise in the market as well as to facilitate compliance of providers and notified bodies with their obligations under this regulation the ai on demand platform the european digital innovation hubs and the testing and experimentation facilities established by the commission and the member states at national or eu level should possibly contribute to the implementation of this regulation\",\"the usa and the uk take a more decentralised approach relying on the existing powers of regulators rather than establishing new monitoring bodies\",\"ai industry standards or codes of conduct may potentially complement the regulatory system by helping firms build trust amongst users that their systems meet widely accepted industry norms which may extend beyond the minimum requirements for regulatory compliance\",\"in line with the differing overarching approaches taken to ai risk the regulatory requirements differ within the five jurisdictions\",\"to ensure uniform implementation across the union and economies of scale it is appropriate to establish common rules for the regulatory sandboxes implementation and a framework for cooperation between the relevant authorities involved in the supervision of the sandboxes\",\"on the other hand it puts in place a proportionate regulatory system centred on a well defined risk based regulatory approach that does not create unnecessary restrictions to trade whereby legal intervention is tailored to those concrete situations where there is a justified cause for concern or where such concern can reasonably be anticipated in the near future\",\"additionally they ask that regulators consider lighter touch options such as guidance or voluntary measures in the first instance\",\"second we present the comparative framework which considers seven features of the regulatory approach of each of the five jurisdictions\",\"beginning with our current regulatory framework we have considered how key existing sectoral legal requirements and guidance in uk financial services apply to ai\",\"we reviewed ai regulatory policy documents published on the oecds ai policy observatory and filtered them based on an inclusionexclusion criteria that can be found in appendix\",\"exclusion criteria governance initiatives that do not include a hard or soft regulatory element that are drafted by sub national or non governmental bodies or that do not specifically focus on ai in any part of the document\",\"due to the uk following a sector led approach to ai governance the specific monitoring and enforcement mechanisms will depend on the powers afforded to each specific regulator\",\"the objectives of the regulatory sandboxes should be to foster ai innovation by establishing a controlled experimentation and testing environment in the development and pre marketing phase with a view to ensuring compliance of the innovative ai systems with this regulation and other relevant union and member states legislation to enhance legal certainty for innovators and the competent authorities oversight and understanding of the opportunities emerging risks and the impacts of ai use and to accelerate access to markets including by removing barriers for small and medium enterprises smes and start ups\",\"these initial categories were based on consultations with ai policy experts from ceimia and the project steering committee who outlined areas of ai regulatory policy that they considered important for our audience\",\"the regulation of ai under the aida will focus on those persons carrying out a regulated activity which means any of the following in the course of international or interprovincial trade and commerceprocessing or making available for use any data relating to human activities for the purpose of designing developing or using an ai system ordesigning developing or making available for use an ai system or managing its operations\",\"chinas ministry of science and technology provides overarching direction for chinas monitoring and enforcement typically through guidance with the cyberspace administration of china cac introducing and enforcing hard law measures related to specific ai technologies and data protection\",\"the expert group produced a report innovember that assessed the challenges some characteristics of ai pose to national civilliability rules\",\"varying your governance for projects using ai\",\"over the past three years the ai governance landscape has become considerably more defined with several governments proposing regulatory policies for governing ai within their jurisdictions\",\"national approaches in addressing the problems will only create additional legal uncertainty and barriers and will slow market uptake of ai\",\"this dp sits within the broader context of this global debate and focuses on a specific area  the regulation of ai within uk financial services\",\"in addition to legal requirements and guidance targeted at particular risks such as risks to consumers or effective competition the supervisory authorities have identified sets of cross cutting legal requirements and guidance that encompasses multiple areas of risk\",\"ai regulatory sandboxes establish a controlled environment to test innovative technologies for a limited time on the basis of a testing plan agreed with the competent authorities\",\"while the comparative framework is mostly based on the regulatory policy documents of the five jurisdictions analysed in this report we took two steps to ensure the robustness of the categories when adding other governments approaches later in this project\",\"codifying the role of the commissioner would separate the functions from other activities within ised and allow the commissioner to build a centre of expertise in ai regulation\",\"regulatory sandboxes could be very useful for the promotion of ai and are welcomed by certain stakeholders especially the business associations\",\"in addition to the policy paper on the uks approach to regulating ai several policy documents have been released by other government bodies\",\"the cac chinas internet regulator has been most active in introducing hard regulatory measures related to different ai technologies\",\"annex  sets out an overview of certain key existing legal requirements and guidance relevant to data and ai\",\"similarly other governments and regulators around the world are developing their thinking and approaches to ai\",\"this includes understanding which areas of the current regulatory framework  would benefit from further clarification with respect to ai ii could be extended to better encompass ai and iii could act as a regulatory barrier to the safe and responsible adoption of ai in uk financial services\",\"this will include strategies that dont specify ai governance approach eg\",\"an office headed by a new ai and data commissioner would be created as a centre of expertise in support of both regulatory development and administration of the act\",\"the proposed regulation provides for a cooperation and coordination mechanism for the supervision of the obligations it imposes\",\"the supervisory authorities are publishing this dp to further our understanding and to deepen dialogue on how ai may affect our respective objectives\",\"the initial set of regulations would then be published in part  of the canada gazette\",\"canadas approach and consultation timelinecanada already possesses robust legal frameworks that apply to many of the uses of ai\",\"the machinery regulation applies the same definition of ai system as this regulation\",\"in this section we analyse how risk is framed or defined in each jurisdictions approach to ai regulatory policy and how if at all a jurisdiction builds a framework for risk management\",\"the common thread amongst this plethora of international initiatives is the aim to foster dialogue and advance common frameworks for ai governance\",\"in addition sector specific laws cover situations where adapted approaches are necessary\",\"while the supervisory authorities generally take a technology neutral approach to regulation see box  for more details they are aware that risks may relate to the use of specific technologies\",\"for the development of high risk ai systems certain actors such as providers notified bodies and other relevant entities such as digital innovation hubs testing experimentation facilities and researchers should be able to access and use high quality datasets within their respective fields of activities which are related to this regulation\",\"additionally although the usa and china have both taken more decentralised approaches to ai regulatory policy than the eu or canada chinas cyberspace administration has introduced hard law initiatives for specific ai technologies while the usas federal approach has largely relied on voluntary measures or guidance on applying existing sectoral legislation\",\"moreover the framework will envisage specific measures supporting innovation including regulatory sandboxes and specific measures supporting small scale users and providers of high risk ai systems to comply with the new rules\",\"each of these regulatory policies introduces different specific requirements or guidance related to public sector use of ai\",\"regulation within this area is more general requiring firms to have strong data architecture and risk management infrastructure\",\"while this document considers science and technology in general it is indicative of further regulatory measures being introduced and review bodies established that apply to ai research and development\",\"the general rules guidance and principles will be relevant to the firms use of ai\",\"at a high level similarities can be drawn between the eu and canada on the one hand who introduce horizontal hard law regulations for ai that are relatively centralised and the usa uk and china on the other who rely more on different types of decentralised regulatory policy\",\"like the initiatives proposed in the eu and canada these policies introduce specific prohibitions and legal requirements for ai see section\",\"given the extent of overlaps within the existing sectoral rules policies and principles in uk financial services that apply to ai the supervisory authorities approach is largely limited to clarifying how the existing regulatory framework applies to ai and addressing any identified gaps in the regulatory framework\",\"this is particularly true now while ai adoption is still in its initial stages and the technology itself as well as the associated laws regulations governance and risk management best practices are still developing quickly\",\"it is likely that member states would have continued applying their own regulatory systems without any common set of principles and that some member states would have continued to have no horizontal rules in place at all\",\"in the uk much of the existing guidance has been focused on the public sector including public sector procurement compliance with equalities law and police use of facial recognition technology\",\"box  the supervisory authorities use of aithe supervisory authorities utilise ai where appropriate to support and enhance their capabilities\",\"title i defines the subject matter of the regulation and the scope of application of the new rules that cover the placing on the market putting into service and use of ai systems\",\"the government intends to build on this framework through an open and transparent regulatory development process\",\"it is incumbent on framework users to continue to execute the govern function as knowledge cultures and needs or expectations from ai actors evolve over time\",\"as with other dps the supervisory authorities may choose to publish the anonymised and aggregated responses to this dp to help inform the public debate on ai\",\"while this report focuses on applying our comparative framework to these five early mover jurisdictions we designed the categories to be jurisdiction agnostic and robust to future policy developments\",\"the potential for ai innovation to assist the supervisory authorities and regulatory activity depends significantly on access to data and technology so may have implications for the data that firms are required to share\",\"the cyberspace administration of china cac has complemented this overarching soft law approach by releasing hard law measures\",\"the uks approach which is most clearly laid out in the document establishing a pro innovation approach to regulating ai  proposes a sector led approach that relies on regulators to address the impacts of ai in their specific context\",\"regulatory offences could be prosecuted in more serious cases of non compliance with regulatory obligations\",\"while differences in ai regulatory policies are understandable and expected given the different aspirations and governance institutions of each jurisdiction some types of divergence could bring about negative outcomes\",\"understanding the similarities and differences between different governments approaches is an important first step for promoting deeper cooperation and improved interoperability of regulatory frameworks for ai\",\"at the same time there are various challenges to the supervisory authorities providing a more precise definition as the basis for clarification or additional or alternative regulatory requirements\",\"accordingly future regulatory policy in china will likely come from a combination of initiatives covering science and technology research in general as well as measures more specifically focused on the development and use of ai technologies\",\"for the supervisory authorities there may be a number of benefits to providing a more precise definition of ai in their respective rulebooks\",\"other financial services regulators and authorities have explicitly noted the importance of proportionality in relation to the regulation of ai\",\"therefore such use and processing should only be possible in as far as it is compatible with the framework set by this regulation without there being scope outside that framework for the competent authorities where they act for purpose of law enforcement to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the grounds listed in article  of directive eu\",\"however unlike ai regulation in the eu and canada which has sought to address ai technologies in general the approach taken by the cac has been more targeted at specific types of ai such as recommender systems  and generative algorithms\",\"cross cutting legal requirements and guidance are relevant primarily to the three key stages of the ai lifecycle  data models and governance\",\"following this we revised the categories iteratively based on a content analysis of published regulatory policies from canada china the eu the uk and the usa as of january\",\"in this report we develop a comparative framework that we apply to five governments approaches to ai regulatory policy canada china the european union eu the united kingdom uk and the united states of america usa\",\"pioneer fund to help regulators promote cutting edge regulatory practices when developing emerging technologies\",\"since ai is of general application across all sectors and activities all laws potentially apply to the use of ai and some particularly relating to privacy and ip are already significant considerations\",\"it is specified in the uks policy document establishing a pro innovation approach to regulating ai  that ai will be regulated based on its use and the impact it has on individuals groups and businesses within a particular context and that responsibility will be delegated to regulators for designing and implementing proportionate regulatory responses\",\"the supervisory authorities are keen to gather feedback from stakeholders as to whether additional clarification of existing legal requirements and guidance in respect of ai may be helpful if the current regulatory framework could benefit from extension to better encompass ai and how the supervisory authorities may best support the safe and responsible adoption of ai in uk financial services\",\"in this report we develop an accessible comparative framework that captures the key similarities and differences in governments approaches to regulatory policy for governing ai\",\"the uk government aims to address these challenges by creating a framework for regulating ai that is context specific pro innovation and risk based coherent proportionate and adaptable\",\"on top of this the uks emphasis on proportionate and light touch regulatory policies means that there is also a significant role for self monitoring and enforcement within the uks approach\",\"on top of this the approach proposes specific characteristics of ai and a set of cross sectoral principles that will guide sector led governance however like the usas bor the uk stresses that the interpretation of these principles should be context dependent\",\"international developments in artificial intelligence regulationcountries regions and inter governmental organizations are working on guidance standards regulation and laws specific to ai\",\"for instance in march  a regulation on algorithmic recommendations came into force introducing a variety of requirements and prohibitions in relation to these technologies\",\"in particular national competent authorities shall have a sufficient number of personnel permanently available whose competences and expertise shall include an in depth understanding of artificial intelligence technologies data and data computing fundamental rights health and safety risks and knowledge of existing standards and legal requirements\",\"the modalities and the conditions of the operation of the ai regulatory sandboxes including the eligibility criteria and the procedure for the application selection participation and exiting from the sandbox and the rights and obligations of the participants shall be set out in implementing acts\",\"we hope that our comparative framework can be used to analyse present and future regulatory ai approaches according to a common ground and in turn foster enhanced cooperation\",\"one of the most significant questions is whether ai can be managed through clarifications of the existing regulatory framework or whether a new approach is needed\",\"additional measures are also proposed to support innovation in particular through ai regulatory sandboxes and other measures to reduce the regulatory burden and to support small and medium sized enterprises smes and start ups\",\"the supervisory authorities note that certain third parties providing data and ai models could emerge as future potential ctps as a result of the increasing use of these data and models\",\"this includes a greater reliance on vertical regulations ie which applies to only a specific application of ai or a specific sector which are enforced by different regulatory agencies\",\"in the absence of effective regulation and enforcement they can set the rules of the game without effectively identifying and mitigating the risks and the societal and economic harm they can cause\",\"if you intend to use ai to process special category data or data about criminal offences then you will need to ensure you comply with the requirements of articles  and  of the uk gdpr as well as the dpa\",\"certain member states have already explored the adoption of national rules to ensure that artificial intelligence is safe and is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights obligations\",\"looking forward the publication of the opinion on strengthening the ethics and governance in science and technology indicates that harder regulatory measures may be introduced and enforced by other regulatory bodies within china given the emphasis within the document on improving regulatory frameworks for science and technology research\",\"subsidiaritythe objectives of this proposal cannot be adequately achieved at national level becauseemerging divergent national rules would increase legal uncertainty and fragmentationcreating obstacles to the rollout of ai enabled products and services across the internalmarket\",\"to this end they should appoint at least one authority with the task to apply and enforce this regulation\",\"furthermore while self regulatory initiatives have generally shown positive results they cannot be legally enforced nor do they cover all participants in the digital economy\",\"there is broad international consensus on the key legal and regulatory challenges of ai safety including robustness of performance and cyber security transparency and explainability accountability human control bias mitigation and privacy protection see for example the european commissions ethics guidelines for trustworthy ai\",\"this divergence has the potential to undermine fledgling international initiatives create a fragmented regulatory landscape and bring about challenges for regulatory interoperability\",\"this in turn leads to an increased effectiveness of enforcement and supervision measures whereas the current system relies to a large extent on the limited capability for supervision in a small number of member states\",\"in particular a fragmented regulatory environment that lacks a high degree of mutual recognition could create barriers for interoperability and trade\",\"one of the central questions is whether the technology can be managed through extensions of existing regulatory frameworks or whether a new approach is needed\",\"we then apply this framework to the regulatory approaches of five ai early movers in ai regulatory policy  canada china the european union eu the united kingdom uk and the united states of america usa  including a detailed comparative analysis of their approaches to risk regulatory requirements with deep dives into the role of technical standards impact assessments and audit and monitoring and enforcement\",\"regulatory requirements the eu and canada both take a horizontal hard law approach proposing a series of requirements that vary in stringency and type based on their respective classifications of ai systems in levels of risk eu and impact canada\",\"at the same time the uk government has sought to develop a national position on regulating ai across all sectors with the publication in july  of a policy paper establishing a pro innovation approach to regulating ai july  policy paper\",\"accordingly if an exhaustive understanding of each jurisdictions approach is sought other academic and legal resources should be consulted in conjunction with this reportwith these caveats in mind the target audience we foresee this analysis will be most valuable for includes policymakers who want to contextualise their approaches to regulatory policy in relation to other jurisdictions or understand existing options for specific governance challenges international and national bodies including standards organisations seeking to promote cooperation or convergence in governance between different jurisdictions multinational corporations and smes trying to understand and respect the different requirements that may apply to them in different jurisdictions prospective audit and certification bodies seeking to develop and provide bespoke ai auditing and certification services civil society organisations that seek a comparable high level understanding of regulatory policy in each jurisdiction researchers who want to understand relevant similarities and differences between governments approaches to ai regulatory policy\",\"the government of canada has been at the forefront of ai standards development both for its internal oversight of ai systems and to support external regulatory objectives\",\"introduction as noted in the foreword there is a wide ranging debate about the regulation of ai\",\"that said the policy document highlights the importance of regulatory coordination for this approach to work to avoid contradictory approaches and help spot emerging issues\",\"prohibit reckless and malicious uses of ai that cause serious harm to canadians and their interests through the creation of new criminal law provisions\",\"this emphasis on sector led governance and light touch instruments is designed to ensure comprehensive regulatory coverage and flexibility so that the uk approach can be regularly updated based on new opportunities and risks from ai\",\"differing national rules may lead to fragmentation of the internal market and decrease legal certainty for operators that develop or use ai systems\",\"generally the supervisory authorities adopt a technology neutral approach in their supervisory and regulatory approaches\",\"the government will take an agile approach to ai regulation in the coming years by developing and evaluating regulations and guidelines in close collaboration with stakeholders on a regular cycle and adapting enforcement to the needs of the changing environment\",\"moreover the uk governments proposed approach to regulating ai is underpinned by a set of cross sectoral principles tailored to the specific characteristics of aiensure that ai is used safelyensure that ai is technically secure and functions as designedmake sure that ai is appropriately transparent and explainableembed considerations of fairness into aidefine legal persons responsibility for ai governanceclarify routes to redress or contestabilitythe uk government stated that it will be considering the roles powers remits and capabilities of regulators the need for coordination and how this should be delivered across the range of regulators statutory and non statutory involved in ai regulation as part of its next steps\",\"the uk approach is context based and sector led with regulators asked to apply their existing powers and expertise to ai focusing on light touch options in the first instance\",\"this divergence has the potential to undermine international cooperation on ai governance and bring about challenges for regulatory interoperability\",\"understanding the similarities and differences between different governments approaches is an important first step for promoting deeper cooperation and improved interoperability of regulatory frameworks for ai technologies\",\"regulatory fitness and simplificationthe impact assessment accompanying this proposal identifies the sole added value of union intervention addressing the risk of legal fragmentation triggered by divergent regulatory and supervisory approaches hence without accounting for the increased safety and trust on digital services in a possible increase of cross border digital trade of  to  ie\",\"in those cases the supervisory authorities may issue guidance or use other policy tools to clarify how the existing rules and relevant regulatory expectations apply to those technologies\",\"since  policymakers globally have been increasingly focused on the development and implementation of initiatives and national strategies for the governance of artificial intelligence ai systems\",\"this report and our subsequent publications in this project will aid stakeholders in having this contextualised understanding of ai regulatory policy as ai regulatory policy continues to mature it is crucial that policymakers and other key stakeholders leverage this contextual understanding to promote regulatory cooperation coordination and where appropriate alignment\",\"gatekeeper related problems are currently not effectively addressed by member states or the eu in existing regulation\",\"this was aided by the diversity of the approaches taken by the early movers which necessitated a high degree of generality to ensure comparability second we cross referenced the comparative framework with a sample of regulatory policies from other jurisdictions to ensure its applicabilitywe use the same corpus of ai regulatory policies to inform the granular analysis of each governments approach in section four\",\"the policy document establishing a pro innovation approach to regulating ai specifies that there should be evidence of real risk rather than hypothetical risks however the document states that it anticipates that regulators will establish risk based criteria and thresholds for the specific contexts that they are regulating\",\"chapter  sets out the legal requirements for high risk ai systems in relation to data and data governance documentation and recording keeping transparency and provision of information to users human oversight robustness accuracy and security\",\"standards can also potentially complement the regulatory system by helping firms build trust among users that their systems meet widely accepted standards which may go above satisfying minimum requirements for regulatory compliance\",\"in canada the main policies at the heart of its regulatory approach are the proposed artificial intelligence and data act aida and the already adopted directive on automated decision making\",\"market surveillance authorities would also control the market and investigate compliance with the obligations and requirements for all high risk ai systems already placed on the market\",\"it is important that the regulatory environment is proportionate and conducive to facilitating safe and responsible adoption of ai so as not to act as a barrier to beneficial innovation\",\"finally with regards to federal legislation the usas approach is characterised by a patchwork of sectoral legislation see under regulatory requirements which are enforced by appointed competent authorities\",\"some of the data and model issues can also have implications for governance\",\"most of the data in government available to train our models is within legacy systems which might contain bias and might have poor controls around it\",\"to achieve those objectives this proposal presents a balanced and proportionate horizontal regulatory approach to ai that is limited to the minimum necessary requirements to address the risks and problems linked to ai without unduly constraining or hindering technological development or otherwise disproportionately increasing the cost of placing ai solutions on the market\",\"however ai can pose novel challenges as well as create new regulatory risks or amplify existing ones\",\"on products and services that will bring further clarity and simplify the enforcement of the new rules\",\"for example government surveillance and data search and seizure are subject to legal requirements and judicial oversight\",\"importantly the uk is planning to publish a white paper which will provide further details on the countrys approach to ai regulatory policy\",\"although it is too early to assess the likelihood of this type of landscape emerging for ai regulatory policy it is a plausible outcome if distinct or mutually exclusive regulatory requirements are introduced given this as the efforts to introduce ai regulatory policies progress it is vital that stakeholders understand the similarities and differences between governments approaches so that they are able to reasonably assess the possibility of fragmentation and promote deeper cooperation\",\"the direct applicability of a regulation in accordance with article  tfeu will reduce legal fragmentation and facilitate the development of a single market for lawful safe and trustworthy ai systems\",\"the key aim guiding aida is to regulate trade by establishing common requirements applicable across canada for the design development and use of ai systems and to avoid harm by prohibiting certain conduct in relation to ai systems with a specific focus on high impact systems\",\"the implementation rate of non binding instruments is difficult to predict and there is insufficient indication that thepersuasive effect of a recommendation would be strong enough to produce consistentadaptation of national laws\",\"this comparative framework contains seven categories  definition of ai  key aims  scope and focal areas  approach to risk  regulatory requirements  monitoring and enforcement and  flexibility and revisions\",\"the global interconnectedness of the digital economy requires that the regulation of ai systems in the marketplace be coordinated internationally\",\"uk national ai strategy state or municipal government initiatives eg\",\"the law and policy landscape for motor vehicles shows that strong safety regulationsand measures to address harms when they occurcan enhance innovation in the context of complex technologies\",\"four policy options of different degrees of regulatory intervention were assessedoption  eu legislative instrument setting up a voluntary labelling schemeoption  a sectoral ad hoc approachoption  horizontal eu legislative instrument following a proportionate riskbased approachoption  horizontal eu legislative instrument following a proportionate riskbased approach  codes of conduct for non high risk ai systemsoption  horizontal eu legislative instrument establishing mandatory requirements for all ai systems irrespective of the risk they pose\",\"for examplewhere financial services firms use ai to process personal data firms may have regulatory obligations under the uk general data protection regulation uk gdpr and the data protection act\",\"recognizing that the regulation of this powerful technology is now an emerging international norm many in the field are worried that regulation will be inflexible or that it will unfairly stigmatize their field of work\",\"they also introduce a series of proportional obligations that vary depending on the person responsible for an ai system in each regulation\",\"regulators pioneer fund to help regulators promote cuttingedge regulatory practices when developing emerging technologies\",\"one area where the uk has been particularly interested in developing regulatory policy is in the area of assurance\",\"firstly these countries have been early movers in terms of outlining their distinct approaches to ai governance which may to varying degrees have an influence on the policy decisions made in other jurisdictions secondly they rank highly on many relevant metrics for international influence in the field of ai governance including leading in research and development investment domiciled ai companies and having the foundations necessary for maintaining influence eg an internationally leading education sector\",\"it is important to acknowledge from the outset that the comparative framework developed in this report is a heuristic for understanding key similarities and differences between jurisdictions approaches to ai regulatory policy\",\"indeed existing consumer protection regulators are already moving to address some of the impacts of ai within their legislative authorities\",\"there were many comments underlining the importance of a technology neutral and proportionate regulatory framework\",\"at the same time the legal framework includes flexible mechanisms that enable it to be dynamically adapted as the technology evolves and new concerning situations emerge\",\"to overcome these issues we considered the wider context of the documents in our analysis for instance by specifying that some legislation are more likely to pass than others and linking specific regulatory documents that act as reference points for a countrys approach to regulatory policy\",\"document focused on regulatory policies for ai in the defence sector\",\"however the government is cognizant that developments in ai have created regulatory gaps that must be filled in order for canadians to trust the technology\",\"in china monitoring and enforcement is also conducted by a variety of regulators each with different responsibilities and often taking different approaches\",\"their supervisory function could build on existing arrangements for example regarding conformity assessment bodies or market surveillance but would require sufficient technological expertise and human and financial resources\",\"those investigatory powers aim to complement the commissions possibility to ask digital services coordinators and other member states authorities for assistance for instance by providing information or in the exercise of those powerscompliance with the relevant obligations imposed under this regulation should be enforceable by means of fines and periodic penalty payments\",\"while the usa is more likely to rely on existing not ai specific sectoral regulation china has developed overarching soft law ethical guidance for ai in general and hard law regulatory requirements targeted at specific types of ai technologies\",\"the responses to this dp will help inform both the supervisory authorities thinking and any potential future policy proposals which will sit within the wider domestic and international context of emerging ai regulation\",\"in addition this proposal complements other strands in the commissions ai policy based onpreventive regulatory and supervisory requirements aimed directly at avoiding fundamentalrights breaches such as discrimination\",\"the supervisory authorities may therefore issue technology specific rules and guidance where appropriate\",\"member states competent authorities that have established ai regulatory sandboxes shall coordinate their activities and cooperate within the framework of the european artificial intelligence board\",\"at the same time ai researchers and innovators are concerned by the uncertainty that exists regarding future regulation\",\"this is notably the case for expert panels expert laboratories and reference laboratories in the field of medical devices pursuant to regulation eu  and regulation eu\",\"new yorks ai audit law legislative documents which do not specifically relate to ai even if theyare used to enforce protections eg\",\"the regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence and amending certain union legislative acts defines a new common framework of requirements applicable to ai systems which goes well beyond the framework provided by existing legislation\",\"the uk government is planning to reform these laws including amending the right to human intervention in the data protection and digital information bill which is currently at the second reading stage in the house of commons\",\"this regulation shall not apply to public authorities in a third country nor to international organisations falling within the scope of this regulation pursuant to paragraph  where those authorities or organisations use ai systems in the framework of international agreements for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the union or with one or more member states\",\"in addition to administration and enforcement of the act the commissioners work would include supporting and coordinating with other regulators to ensure consistent regulatory capacity across different contexts as well as tracking and studying of potential systemic effects of ai systems in order to inform administrative and policy decisions\",\"however adopting ai applications may require you to re assess your existing governance and risk management practices\",\"the ai regulatory sandboxes shall not affect the supervisory and corrective powers of the competent authorities\",\"to help address this challenge this chapter discusses some parts of the current regulatory framework that are considered by the supervisory authorities to be most relevant to the regulation of ai\",\"we specifically chose this inclusive understanding of regulatory policy that encompasses soft law initiatives as many jurisdictions currently favour lighter touch approaches which a hard law focus would not capture\",\"see table a in appendix  for a mapping of the uk government ai regulation principles against the dp chapters and sections\",\"this enhanced information sharing can considerably expand the scope of regulatory review by government compliance and enforcement agencies\",\"these include  the difficulty to create a robust definition that would remain relevant in what is undoubtedly a rapidly developing field ii challenges of a definition that is too broad as this could cause regulation to lack specificity precision and proportionality iii potential for certain use cases products and services to fall outside of scope when they should not and iv creating the ability and incentives for firms to misclassify ai to reduce regulatory oversight\",\"overall the main aims that can be inferred from various ai regulatory policies are to preserve national security and stability protect the public interest and the interests of citizens qua consumers and to stimulate the healthy development of ai technologies\",\"regarding regulatory measures these have mostly been introduced by the cac and have focused on specific ai technologies\",\"the usa uk and china have taken more decentralised approaches that rely on a patchwork of regulatory policies\",\"how to regulate ai to ensure it delivers in the best interests of consumers firms and markets is the subject of a wide ranging debate both here in the uk and in other jurisdictions around the world\",\"the july  policy paper highlighted several key challenges that cut across the regulatory landscape including a lack of clarity overlaps inconsistencies and gaps in the current approach\",\"the ai and data commissioner would assess the progress of the ecosystem over time and ensure that administration and enforcement activities take into account the capabilities and scale of impact of regulated organizations\",\"congress has not yet passed legislation concerning ai regulation\",\"as the rest of this guidance suggests the data protection implications of ai are heavily dependent on the specific use cases the population they are deployed on other overlapping regulatory requirements as well as social cultural and political considerations\",\"against this political context the commission puts forward the proposed regulatory framework on artificial intelligence with the following specific objectives ensure that ai systems placed on the union market and used are safe and respect existing law on fundamental rights and union valuesensure legal certainty to facilitate investment and innovation in aienhance governance and effective enforcement of existing law on fundamentalrights and safety requirements applicable to ai systemsfacilitate the development of a single market for lawful safe and trustworthy ai applications and prevent market fragmentation\",\"the regulatory policy requirements related to ai in the usa uk and china are more decentralised but each takes a different approach\",\"when necessary for their mandate existing supervision and enforcement authorities will also have the power to request and access any documentation maintained following this regulation and where needed request market surveillance authorities to organise testing of the high risk ai system through technical means\",\"the choice of a regulation as a legal instrument is justified by the need for a uniform application of the new rules such as definition of ai the prohibition of certain harmful aienabled practices and the classification of certain ai systems\",\"some jurisdictions intend to establish new monitoring bodies to enforce their respective ai regulations\",\"govern  legal and regulatory requirements involving aiare understood managed and documented\",\"member states are increasingly introducing or are considering introducing national laws on the matters covered by this regulation imposing in particular diligence requirements for providers of intermediary services\",\"discussion questions for stakeholder inputthis dp seeks to explore whether stakeholders consider the existing sectoral legal requirements and guidance to be sufficient to address the risks and harms associated with ai where there may be gaps in existing legal requirements and guidance andor how any additional intervention may support the safe and responsible adoption of ai in uk financial markets\",\"box  uk government  establishing a pro innovation approach to regulating aithe uk government published the july  policy paper which set out its emerging thinking on its approach to regulating ai\",\"existing comparisons of different governments approaches to ai regulatory policy take the form of repositories most notably the oecd ai observatorys policy tracker or academic analyses that compare two or more jurisdictions repositories are useful for providing an aggregate picture of the different policy documents that have been published however they do not offer an analytical function for understanding the similarities and differences between different jurisdictions\",\"however in view of the divergences when transposing and applying the relevant rules at national level and for reasons of clarity and coherence that framework should be incorporated in this regulation\",\"more legal certainty on interaction with authorities platforms will have to cooperate with authorities that issue legal orders that have minimum common criteria\",\"however the shortage of ai specialists hampers regulatory work internationally see for example this report by the uks turing institute\",\"artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing family of technologies that requires novel forms of regulatory oversight and a safe space for experimentation while ensuring responsible innovation and integration of appropriate safeguards and risk mitigation measures\",\"governments regulators and other authorities have published numerous documents on the subject\",\"clear gatekeeper obligations across the eutoday the way in which gatekeepers conduct their businesses is either largely unregulated or based on sets of rules many of which pre date the digital economy\",\"in particular a fragmented regulatory environment could create significant barriers for governments seeking to deepen cooperation and organisations looking to deploy responsible ai systems across borders\",\"the governance and regulation of ai is an emerging area which will evolve rapidly in the coming years\",\"these examples illustrate the usas emphasis on the enforcement of existing sectoral regulations adapted to ai\",\"to that end it encourages national competent authorities to set up regulatory sandboxes and sets a basic framework in terms of governance supervision and liability\",\"it also includes discussion of how financial services regulation sits alongside a body of cross sectoral legislation and regulation as well as the domestic and international context of emerging ai specific legal requirements and guidance\",\"legal compliance has relevant regulation been considered in relation to the dataset used both in the uk and if necessary overseas\",\"in particular the supervisory authorities are interested in the additional challenges and risks that ai brings to firms decision making and governance processes and how those may be addressed through the senior managers and certification regime smcr and other existing regulatory tools\",\"the chapter then explores the potential merits of providing a regulatory definition for ai and how regulators in other jurisdictions are approaching this\",\"part   sets out a separate regime for law enforcement authorities\",\"each approach aims to provide clarity of what constitutes ai within the context of a specific regulatory regime and therefore what restrictions and requirements may apply to the use of the technology\",\"member states shall ensure that to the extent the innovative ai systems involve the processing of personal data or otherwise fall under the supervisory remit of other national authorities or competent authorities providing or supporting access to data the national data protection authorities and those other national authorities are associated to the operation of the ai regulatory sandbox\",\"governance  ai may also pose some novel challenges for governance especially where the technology is used to facilitate autonomous decision making and may limit or even potentially eliminate human judgement and oversight from decisions\",\"ai regulatory sandboxes established by one or more member states competent authorities or the european data protection supervisor shall provide a controlled environment that facilitates the development testing and validation of innovative ai systems for a limited time before their placement on the market or putting into service pursuant to a specific plan\",\"some member states are already considering national rules to ensure that ai is safe and is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights obligations\",\"governance related legal requirements and guidance including notably the smcr are focused on proper procedures clear accountability and effective risk management across the ai lifecycle at various levels of operations\",\"in contrast to the approaches taken by the eu and canada this will place the burden for designing regulatory policy for ai on several different regulators\",\"a first step towards this ambition is clarifying how existing legal requirements and guidance apply to the use of ai\",\"be lawand regulation agnostic\",\"nonetheless this regulation should not hamper the development and use of innovative approaches in the public administration which would stand to benefit from a wider use of compliant and safe ai systems provided that those systems do not entail a high risk to legal and natural persons\",\"while ai governance initiatives are still nascent distinct approaches to regulatory policy appear to be emerging in different jurisdictions\",\"in the usa several regulatory policies address risks associated with the development and use of ai systems in both the public and private sector\",\"inter operability with legal frameworks in other jurisdictions would also be a key consideration in the development of regulations in order to facilitate canadian companies access to international markets\",\"standards are of particular note for this report as they can be used to both demonstrate conformity with emerging ai regulation and promote interoperability among different jurisdictions\",\"the minister of innovation science and industry would be empowered to administer and enforce the act to ensure that policy and enforcement move together as the technology evolves\",\"regulation of ai under the aida is focused on organizations carrying out a regulated activity which means  processing or making available for use any data relating to human activities for the purpose of designing developing or using an ai system or  designing developing or making available for use an ai system or managing its operations\",\"regulation this chapter discusses some of the current legal requirements and guidance that are considered by the supervisory authorities to be most relevant to mitigating the risks associated with ai\",\"it would also work together with and support other regulators operating in the ai space in order to ensure that canadians are protected in a consistent and effective manner across regulatory contexts\",\"the guidance from iosco measure   governance and responsibilities states that regulators should consider requiring firms to have designated senior management responsible for the oversight of ai development testing deployment monitoring and controls\",\"to ensure a legal framework that is innovation friendly futureproof and resilient to disruption national competent authorities from one or more member states should be encouraged to establish artificial intelligence regulatory sandboxes to facilitate the development and testing of innovative ai systems under strict regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market or otherwise put into service\",\"member states shall undertake the following actionsprovide small scale providers and start ups with priority access to the ai regulatory sandboxes to the extent that they fulfil the eligibility conditionsorganise specific awareness raising activities about the application of this regulation tailored to the needs of the small scale providers and userswhere appropriate establish a dedicated channel for communication with small scale providers and user and other innovators to provide guidance and respond to queries about the implementation of this regulation\",\"this approach is designed to provide a clear innovation friendly and flexible approach to regulating ai that addresses harms within particular contexts and can be regularly updated\",\"this dp should also be considered within the context of the evolving wider national and international policy debate on ai including the uk governments policy paper establishing a pro innovation approach to regulating aiopens in a new window joint working between uk regulators through the digital regulation cooperation forum drcf and international developments from other regulators and authorities such as the proposed ai regulation for the eu\",\"over the past three years the ai governance landscape has become considerably

you can provide your service without this processing ie if the personalisation of content by means of an ai system is not integral to the service you should consider an alternative lawful

businesses in direct competition with a gatekeeper who can use such data to its own interest\",\"you should also document how you have considered the risks to the individuals that are having their personal data processed\",\"when you use ai to process personal data you must ensure that it is lawful fair and transparent\",\"if you can achieve the same outcome by processing less personal data then by definition the data minimisation principle requires you to do so\",\"the personal information protection law requires an ex ante data protection impact assessment if personal information is handled or used for automated decision making\",\"therefore you need to review your data governance practices and systems to ensure they remain fit for purpose\",\"companies collect student data such as demographic information free or reduced lunch status whether theyve used drugs or whether theyve expressed interest in lgbtqi groups and then use that data to forecast student successparents and education experts have expressed concern about collection of such sensitive data without express parental consent the lack of transparency in how such data is being used and the potential for resulting discriminatory impacts\",\"patients were not aware that the data would be used in this way or monitored by anyone other than their doctor\",\"in cases where confidence information provided by a ml system can be exploited as in the frt example above the risk could be mitigated by not providing it to the end user\",\"entities should allow to the extent legally permissible withdrawal of data access consent resulting in the deletion of user data metadata and the timely removal of their data from any systems eg machine learning models derived from that data\",\"people whose data is collected used shared or stored by automated systems should be able to access data and metadata about themselves know who has access to this data and be able to correct it if necessary\",\"relevance of data should not be established solely by appealing to its historical connection to the outcome\",\"if an ai system can perform well enough without being trained on the individuals personal data performance of the contract does not depend on such processing\",\"new data sources such as social media data and biometric data are increasingly being used by analysts to identify social trends and using these sources raises ethical questions surrounding confidentiality\",\"in these cases if the training data is personal data access to the model by itself means that the organisation purchasing the model will already have access to a subset of the personal data contained in the training data without having to exert any further efforts\",\"a number of techniques exist which can help you to minimise the amount of personal data you need to process\",\"in cases where you implement an ai system from a third party any processing of personal data undertaken by the developer will have been for a different purpose eg to develop the system to what you intend to use the system for therefore you may need to identify a different lawful basis\",\"our guidance says that if you make any of the following overarching decisions you will be a controller to collect personal data in the first place\",\"the erasure of one individuals personal data from the training data is unlikely to affect your ability to fulfil the purposes of training an ai system as you are likely to still have sufficient data from other individuals\",\"the data minimisation principle does not mean either process no personal data or if we process more were going to break the law\",\"an insurer might collect data from a persons social media presence as part of deciding what life insurance rates they should be offered\",\"would another researcher be able to reproduce your results with the information available to them\",\"the data use aligns with the data ethics framework\",\"in addition to these considerations about training data and individual rights in general below we outline some considerations about how particular individual rights rectification erasure portability and information may relate to training data\",\"in such circumstances in order to balance interests between theinjured person and the non professional user it needs to be taken into account whethersuch non professional users can add to the risk of an ai system causing damagethrough their behaviour\",\"therefore the chances that one of the relevant individuals makes a request are very small but remains possible\",\"provided data includes data the individual has consciously input into a form but also behavioural or observational data gathered in the process of using a service\",\"for example if the way you intend to use peoples data would be unexpected or cause unnecessary harm\",\"consent withdrawal and data deletion\",\"data quality sourcing and assurance poor quality or inappropriate data can potentially compromise any process that relies upon those data\",\"to manage the risks to individuals that arise from processing personal data in your ai systems it is important that you develop a mature understanding of fundamental rights risks and how to balance these and other interests\",\"the project fits with how citizens and users expect their data to be used\",\"thirdly you need to be transparent about how you process personal data in an ai system to comply with the principle of transparency\",\"access to such data should be limited based on necessity and based on a principle of local control such that those individuals closest to the data subject have more access while those who are less proximate do not eg a teacher has access to their students daily progress data while a superintendent does not\",\"consent should not extend if any of these conditions change consent should be re acquired before using data if the use case changes a time limit elapses or data is transferred to another entity including being shared or sold\",\"although data protection does not dictate how ai designers should do their jobs if you use ai to process personal data you need to comply with the principles of data protection by design and by default\",\"even if the data lacks associated identifiers or contact details and has been transformed through pre processing training data may still be considered personal data\",\"consent should only be used to justify collection of data in cases where it can be appropriately and meaningfully given\",\"the more important it is that the personal data is accurate the greater the effort you should put into checking its accuracy and if necessary taking steps to rectify it\",\"they shall ensure that the repository does not contain any personal data of the recipients of the service to whom the advertisement was or could have been displayed\",\"similarly because civil partnerships were until recently only available to same sex couples data that indicates someone is in a civil partnership may indirectly reveal their sexual orientation\",\"first processing of personal data must be fair\",\"if youre unsure about your use of data consult the data ethics framework guidance to check your project is a safe application and deployment of ai models\",\"where data collectors or automated systems seek consent they should seek it for specific narrow use contexts for specific time durations and for use by specific entities\",\"where this data constitutes personal data it will generally be subject to all of the rights mentioned above unless exemptions or other limitations to those rights apply\",\"there may be times where you are not able to identify an individual in the training data directly or indirectly\",\"this is because in most cases collection of personal data about the use of a service details of how users engage with that service or for the development of new functions within that service are not objectively necessary for the provision of a contract\",\"however unlike in model inversion they dont necessarily learn any additional personal data about the individual\",\"the personal data of the people who an ai system was trained on might be inadvertently revealed by the outputs of the system itself\",\"potential mitigationsonce the dataset has been explored and the data necessary for the research has been determined additional data should be deleted\",\"in addition to being used in the inputs and outputs of a model in some cases personal data might also be contained in a model itself\",\"documented patterns show that personal data is being aggregated by data brokers to profile communities in harmful ways\",\"that information shall not contain personal data\",\"many employers transfer employee data to third party job verification services\",\"this therefore covers personal data contained in the training data\",\"for example the default approach of data scientists in designing and building ai systems might involve collecting and using as much data as possible without thinking about ways they could achieve the same purposes with less data\",\"we recognise that the use of personal data with ai may sometimes make it harder to fulfil individual rights to information access rectification erasure restriction of processing and notification\",\"this section sets out some of the things you should think about when carrying out a dpia for the processing of personal data in ai systems\",\"you may also be required to audit your ai systems to ensure they are compliant with various legislation including but not limited to data protection and this may involve processing of personal data\",\"however if your assessment indicates a high risk to the data protection rights of individuals that you are unable to sufficiently reduce you are required to consult the ico before you can go ahead with the processing\",\"there are some examples in which the use of an ai system to process personal data may be a legal obligation\",\"the law allows for individuals to be able to access any of their individual information stored in a federal system of records if not included under one of the systems of records exempted pursuant to the privacy act\",\"recordkeeping and productionpersons carrying out any regulated activity must also retain records describing in general terms the measures established with respect to the anonymized data high impact system assessments mitigation and monitoring obligations specified above\",\"for example training data may have been stripped of any personal identifiers and contact addresses while still remaining personal data\",\"for example if the data was initially collected on the basis of consent even if the new purpose is compatible you still need to collect a fresh consent for the new purpose\",\"however the original form of the data from which the pre processed data was derived is still subject to the right to data portability if provided by the individual under consent or contract and processed by automated means\",\"the use of personal data in the development and deployment of ai systems may not just pose risks to individuals information rights\",\"as in the training phase there are a number of techniques which you can use to minimise personal data or mitigate risks posed to that data at the inference stage including converting personal data into less human readable formats\",\"data collected based on these identified goals and for a specific context should not be used in a different context without assessing for new privacy risks and implementing appropriate mitigation measures which may include express consent\",\"you should also note that when you are dealing with personal data that results from specific technical processing about the physical physiological or behavioural characteristics of an individual and allows or confirms that individuals unique identification that data is biometric data\",\"if human reviewers can only access or use the same data used by the ai system then arguably they are not taking into account other additional factors\",\"in many contexts the answers the ai system provides will be personal data\",\"often several different organisations will be involved in developing and deploying ai systems which process personal data\",\"your dpia needs to describe the nature scope context and purposes of any processing of personal data\",\"model inversion and membership inferences show that ai models can inadvertently contain personal data\",\"consent may also be an appropriate lawful basis for the use of an individuals data during deployment of an ai system eg for purposes such as personalising the service or making a prediction or recommendation\",\"you must inform individuals if their personal data is going to be used to train an ai system to ensure that processing is fair and transparent\",\"consent may be an appropriate lawful basis in cases where you have a direct relationship with the individuals whose data you want to process\",\"you should note that in the majority of cases you are legally required to complete a dpia if you use ai systems that process personal data\",\"use of anonymized data persons that carry out activities regulated by the act and who process or make available for use anonymized data in the course of the activity must in accordance with the regulations establish measures with respect to  the manner in which data is anonymized and  the usemanagement of anonymized data\",\"you may also receive requests for the erasure of personal data contained within training data\",\"you should ensure any factors that may result in inaccuracies in personal data are corrected and the risk of errors is minimised\",\"it should be not left solely to individuals to carry the burden of reviewing and correcting data\",\"dpias offer you an opportunity to consider how and why you are using ai systems to process personal data and what the potential risks could be\",\"for example you may need to remove certain features from the data or apply privacy enhancing technologies pets before sharing it with another organisation\",\"that information shall not include personal data\",\"if you exercise overall control of the purpose and means of the processing of personal data  you decide what data to process and why  you are a controller\",\"when assessing if ai could help you meet users needs consider if theres data containing the information you need even if disguised or buried\",\"depending on your circumstances you could base your processing of personal data for both development and ongoing use of ai on the legitimate interests lawful basis\",\"raw personal data will usually first have to be converted into a more abstract format for the purposes of prediction\",\"also as discussed in the icos previous report on ai and big data the fact that some data might later in the process be found to be useful for making predictions is not enough to establish why you need to keep it for this purpose nor does it retroactively justify its collection use or retention\",\"the data is still regarded as biometric data under the uk gdpr but is not special category data\",\"so if you can achieve sufficient accuracy with fewer data points or fewer individuals being included or both you should do so\",\"the model fits with the government organisations policy on data use\",\"you should also note that you are unlikely to be able to rely on this basis for processing personal data for purposes such as service improvement of your ai system\",\"if you are procuring such a system you need to consider whether you can justify collecting so much personal data from candidates and if not request the provider modify their system or seek another provider\",\"is the ability to perform repetitive tasks with data without the need for constant human guidance\",\"for example they might interact directly with the person the decision is about to gather such information\",\"do you understand the onward effects of using data in this way\",\"if your problem involves supporting an ongoing business decision process you will need to plan to establish ongoing up to date access to data\",\"accordingly such data should be subject to extra oversight to ensure safety and efficacy\",\"while a patchwork of laws exists to guide the collection and use of personal data in specific contexts including health employment education and credit it can be unclear how these laws apply in other contexts and in an increasingly automated society\",\"the key is that you only process the personal data you need for your purpose\",\"in such cases it may be impossible or involve a disproportionate effort to provide information directly to the individual\",\"what will happen with the data collected and how will it be used going forward\",\"the intention may not be presumed if the distortion of human behaviour results from factors external to the ai system which are outside of the control of the provider or the user\",\"what types of personal data to collect\",\"however in data protection law this is not necessarily considered sufficient to take that data out of scope\",\"however generally speaking the more data points collected about each person and the more people whose data is included in the data set the greater the risks to those individuals even if the data is collected for a specific purpose\",\"this regulation should not be understood as providing for the legal ground for processing of personal data including special categories of personal data where relevant\",\"the eu database shall contain personal data only insofar as necessary for collecting and processing information in accordance with this regulation\",\"security of personal data may not always have been a key priority especially if someone was previously building ai applications with non personal data or in a research capacity\",\"the more noise you inject the less you can learn from the data but in some cases you may be able to inject sufficient noise to render the data pseudonymous in a way which provides a meaningful level of protection\",\"in this case the data is not subject to data portability although it does still constitute personal data and as such other data protection rights still apply eg the right of access\",\"such processing could rely on legal obligation as a basis but this would only cover the auditing and testing of the system not any other use of that data\",\"for example ai models trained on historical data may not account for a breakthrough healthcare treatment which can lead to mispriced policies\",\"similarly ai systems that stop content being published based on the analysis of the creators personal data could impact their freedom of expression\",\"this means that if you deploy an ai model you may not need to process the human interpretable version of the personal data contained in the query\",\"this would not reveal any individuals data from the training data set itself but in practice it would reveal that they had visited one of the hospitals that generated the training data during the period the data was collected\",\"are there any constraints on the data for example does it contain sensitive information such as home addresses\",\"the validity of this data pre processing and other design choices may only come into question as a result of an individuals challenge\",\"if the personal data is not inaccurate then the right to rectification does not apply\",\"this applies to the use of ai just as to other technologies that process personal data\",\"although you must carry out your dpia before the processing of personal data begins you should also consider it to be a live document\",\"you should consult our guidance on determining what is personal data for more information about identifiability\",\"individuals have the right to data portability for data they have provided to a controller where the lawful basis of processing is consent or contract\",\"where that real data can be related to identified or identifiable individuals then the processing of such data must comply with data protection laws\",\"if the data was initially processed for a different purpose and you later decide to use it for the separate purpose of training an ai system you need to inform the individuals concerned as well as ensuring the new purpose is compatible with the previous one\",\"there are specific provisions in data protection law covering individuals rights where processing involves solely automated individual decision making including profiling with legal or similarly significant effects\",\"data use is not compliant with legislation guidance or the government organisations public narrative\",\"they should give the auditor access to all relevant data necessary to perform the audit properly\",\"consider if its ethical and safe to use the data refer to the data ethics framework\",\"if it is unclear whether or not your system may be inferring such data you may want to identify a condition to cover that possibility and reduce your compliance risk although this is not a legal requirement\",\"similarly if personal data on the users device is subsequently accessed by a third party this activity would constitute processing of that data\",\"similarly if you use ai as part of the exercise of your official authority or to perform a task in the public interest set out by law the necessary processing of personal data involved may be based on those grounds\",\"the impact of all this data harvesting is corrosive breeding distrust anxiety and other mental health problems chilling speech protest and worker organizing and threatening our democratic process\",\"if you outsource an ai service to another organisation this could also make the process of responding to rights requests more complicated when the personal data involved is processed by them rather than you\",\"you can apply these types of privacy enhancing techniques to the training data after you have already collected it\",\"however unlike human recruiters you cannot hold an ai system directly responsible or accountable for denying applicants a job\",\"within ai these rights apply wherever personal data is used at any of the various points in the development and deployment lifecycle of an ai system\",\"this is because it can be used to single out the individual it relates to on its own or in combination with other data you may process even if it cannot be associated with a customers name\",\"depending on your context you may also have other sector specific regulatory obligations regarding statistical accuracy or discrimination which you will need to be consider alongside your data protection obligations\",\"to avoid this your records should indicate where ai outputs are not intended to reflect objective facts and any decisions taken on the basis of such personal data should reflect these limitations\",\"data brokers frequently collect consumer data from numerous sources without consumers permission or knowledge\",\"so if you use biometric data for testing and mitigating discrimination in your ai system but not for the purpose of confirming the identity of the individuals within the dataset or making any kind of decision in relation to them the biometric data does not come under article\",\"you are also required to keep a record of all decisions made by an ai system as part of your accountability and documentation obligations\",\"you must not collect personal data on the off chance that it might be useful in the future although you may be able to hold information for a foreseeable event that may not occur but only if you are able to justify it\",\"depending on the technological use case and based on an ethical assessment consent for sensitive data may need to be acquired from a guardian andor child\",\"the right to data portability therefore applies in cases where this processing is based on consent or contract\",\"when personal data is included in models by design it is because certain types of models such as support vector machines svms contain some key examples from the training data in order to help distinguish between new examples during deployment\",\"so even if an adversarial attack does not involve personal data it may still be a nis incident and therefore within the icos remit\",\"typically training data only includes information relevant to predictions such as past transactions demographics or location but not contact details or unique customer identifiers\",\"the key is that individuals understand how you are using their personal data and have consented to this use\",\"this could include knowingly using personal information obtained from a data breach to train an ai system\",\"not collecting such data due to the risks doing so may pose to the other rights and freedoms of those individuals\",\"you should regularly and proactively evaluate the possibility of personal data being inferred from models in light of the state of the art technology so that you minimise the risk of accidental disclosure\",\"in some cases this ethical review may determine that data should not be used or shared for specific uses even with consent\",\"unless the individual presents evidence that their personal data could be inferred from the model you may not be able to determine whether personal data can be inferred and therefore whether the request has any basis\",\"it requires you to take all reasonable steps to make sure the personal data you process is not incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact and where necessary is corrected or deleted without undue delay\",\"the aida does not define anonymized data\",\"either in terms of a further erosion of privacy if human reviewers need to consider additional personal data in order to validate or reject an ai generated output or the possible reintroduction of human biases at the end of an automated process\",\"uses personal data in ways which individuals would not reasonably expect\",\"consideration should be given to the level of control data subjects should have over their own data balancing the risks to individual privacy against the statistical value of the dataset\",\"in these cases the credit score is not included within scope of the right to data portability even if other features are\",\"personal data resulting from further analysis of provided data is not subject to the right to portability\",\"this may have implications depending on what you intend to do with the data  it can be difficult to ensure you collect valid consent for more complicated processing operations such as those involved in ai\",\"in cases where data is provided to an entity eg health insurance company in order to facilitate payment for such a need that data should only be used for that purpose\",\"as part of your compliance with the security principle you should ensure that you actively monitor and take into account the state of the art security practices when using personal data in an ai context\",\"the nature scope context and purposes of the processing of personal data by the ai system and the risks posed to individuals as a result\",\"for the reasons stated above it may be difficult to identify and communicate with the individuals whose personal data is contained in the training data\",\"furthermore even if it is an appropriate ground for the use of the system this may not be an appropriate ground for processing personal data to develop an ai system\",\"you should however note that if your ai system processes personal data you always have to comply with the fundamental data protection principles and cannot trade this requirement away\",\"the purpose or purposes the data are to be used for\",\"you should assess whether the training data contains identified or identifiable personal data of individuals either directly or by those who may have access to the model\",\"meanwhile members of the american public are often unable to access their personal data or make critical decisions about its collection and use\",\"you are therefore unlikely to have a justification for not fulfilling the request to erase their personal data from your training dataset\",\"infer additional context if the information is not present in the data\",\"processing of personal data for the purposes of training a model may not directly affect the individuals but once the model is deployed it may automatically make decisions which have legal or significant effects\",\"is my personal information safe\",\"the possibility for the data to either be special category data anyway or becoming so during the processing ie if the processing involves analysing or inferring any data to do with health or genetic status\",\"in some cases you may not have obtained the training data from the individual and therefore not have had the opportunity to inform them at the time you did so\",\"however unlike human recruiters you cannot hold an ai system directly responsible or accountable for denying applicants a job\",\"in a limited number of cases the processing of personal data by an ai system might be based on protecting the vital interests of the individuals\",\"in some cases some or all of the features used to train the model may themselves be the result of some previous analysis of personal data\",\"businesses or public authorities that develop or use any ai applications not classified as high risk would only have minimal obligations of information\",\"moreover there is a risk that inaccurate and faulty data can be used to make decisions about their lives such as whether they will qualify for a loan or get a job\",\"because these processes involve converting personal data from one form into another potentially less detailed form they may make training data potentially much harder to link to a particular named individual\",\"the way ai systems are developed and deployed means that personal data is often managed and processed in unusual ways\",\"however if the individual provides additional information that enables identification this is no longer the case and you need to fulfil any request they make\",\"it may also impact on your compliance with the data minimisation principle as personal data which includes inferences must be adequate and relevant for your purpose\",\"however where this is personal data you need to consider whether it is necessary to process it for your purposes\",\"using ai to process any personal data has important implications for your security risk profile and you need to assess and manage these carefully\",\"unchecked social media data collection has been used to threaten peoples opportunities undermine their privacy or pervasively track their activityoften without their knowledge or consent\",\"an organisation seeks to rely on legitimate interests for processing personal data for the purposes of training a machine learning model\",\"is the ability to perform repetitive tasks with data without the need for constant human guidance\",\"have you considered whether it is appropriate to anonymise your data and if so what the most appropriate methods of anonymisation will be\",\"however the fact that it is no longer easily human interpretable does not imply that the converted data is no longer personal\",\"conversely use of ai to process personal data for purposes of personalising content may be regarded as necessary for the performance of a contract  but only in some cases\",\"for example the training data may include a greater proportion of male borrowers because in the past fewer women applied for loans and therefore the bank doesnt have enough data about women\",\"in contrast anonymous information means that the information in question is no longer personal data and data protection law does not apply to it\",\"or the overall dataset may be unrepresentative\",\"it is important to note that local processing is not necessarily out of scope of data protection law\",\"to enable this where you are using models which contain personal data by design you should implement them in a way that allows the easy retrieval of these examples\",\"however these are not yet standard practices and the united states lacks a comprehensive statutory or regulatory framework governing the rights of the public when it comes to personal data\",\"special category data is defined as personal data that reveals or concerns the special categories\",\"entities should receive consent before sharing data with other entities and should keep records of what data is shared and with whom\",\"ai systems used to monitor the performance and behaviour of these persons may also impact their rights to data protection and privacy\",\"even if the personal data involved in training is being processed on the users device the organisation which creates and distributes the model is still a controller in so far as it determines the means and purposes of processing\",\"is the data secure and do you have permission to use it\",\"organizations that carry out any regulated activity and process or make available for use anonymized data must establish measures with respect to the manner in which data is anonymized and the use or management of anonymized data\",\"however for consent to apply individuals must have a genuine choice about whether you can use their data\",\"requests for rectification of model outputs or the personal data inputs on which they are based are therefore more likely to be made than requests for rectification of training data\",\"finally the vast quantity of personal data you may hold and process as part of your ai systems is likely to put pressure on any pre existing non ai processes you use to identify and if necessary rectify delete inaccurate personal data whether it is used as input or training test data\",\"to avoid such personal data being misinterpreted as factual you should ensure that your records indicate that they are statistically informed guesses rather than facts\",\"your ai system therefore needs to be sufficiently statistically accurate to ensure that any personal data generated by it is processed lawfully and fairly\",\"it is normally assumed that the personal data of the individuals whose data was used to train an ai system cannot be inferred by simply observing the predictions the system returns in response to new inputs\",\"under the privacy act federal agencies may only retain data about an individual that is relevant and necessary to accomplish an agencys statutory purpose or to comply with an executive order of the president\",\"you may already process personal data in the context of creating statistical models and using those models to make predictions about people\",\"for example the mere possibility that some data might be useful for a prediction is not by itself sufficient for the organisation to demonstrate that processing this data is necessary for building the model\",\"however you should not regard requests about such data as manifestly unfounded or excessive just because they may be harder to fulfil in the context of ai or the motivation for requesting them may be unclear in comparison to other access requests you might typically receive\",\"this may make it harder to understand when and how individual rights apply to this data and more challenging to implement effective mechanisms for individuals to exercise those rights\",\"if there is a less intrusive way of processing their data to provide the same service or if the processing is not in practice objectively necessary for the performance of the contract then you cannot rely on this lawful basis for the processing of data with ai\",\"you should note that whilst the right to erasure is not absolute you still need to consider any erasure request you receive unless you are processing the data on the basis of a legal obligation or public task both of which are unlikely to be lawful bases for training ai systems\",\"to the extent that synthetic data cannot be related to identified or identifiable living individuals it is not personal data and therefore data protection obligations do not apply when you process it\",\"similarly even if you can use performance of a contract as a lawful basis to provide a quote prior to a contract this does not mean you can also use it to justify using that data to develop the ai system\",\"any personal data contained in these models would be there by design and easily retrievable by the third party\",\"data protections accuracy principle applies to all personal data whether it is information about an individual used as an input to an ai system or an output of the system\",\"providers of such ml models and any third parties procuring them should be aware that they may contain personal data in this way\",\"unlike model inversion and membership inference personal data contained in models like this is not an attack vector\",\"might your data system or results be re used outside of their original context and purpose in the future to the disadvantage of individuals groups or communities\",\"establishing clear policies and good practices for the procurement and lawful processing of high quality training and test data is important especially if you do not have enough data internally\",\"whenever you are processing personal data  whether to train a new ai system or make predictions using an existing one  you must have an appropriate lawful basis to do so\",\"avoid inappropriate low quality or irrelevant data use and the compounded harm of its reuserelevant and high quality data\",\"will anyone be identifiable from the data or the research outcomes\",\"identifying the individuals that the training data is about is a potential challenge to ensuring their rights\",\"the project fits with how citizens users expect their data to be used\",\"in this context individual inaccuracies in training data may be less important as they are not likely to affect the performance of the model since they are just one data point among many when compared to personal data that you might use to take action about an individual\",\"if you are using ai to process personal data you therefore need to identify and assess these interests as part of your broader consideration of the risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals and how you will meet your obligations under the law\",\"the deployment of an ai system to process personal data needs to be driven by evidence that there is a problem and a reasoned argument that ai is a sensible solution to that problem not by the mere availability of the technology\",\"in most cases data used for training a model eg demographic information or spending habits counts as data provided by the individual\",\"it is not possible to list all known security risks that might be exacerbated when you use ai to process personal data\",\"the right to rectification may apply to the use of personal data to train an ai system\",\"similarly if the personal data does not allow or confirm an individuals unique identification then it is not biometric data or special category data\",\"by contrast under the aida  a person who carries out a regulated activity and who processes or makes available for use anonymized data in the course of that activity will be required to establish measures with respect to  the manner in which data is anonymized and  the use or management of anonymized data\",\"the uk gdpr recognises that not all organisations involved in the processing will have the same degree of control or responsibility\",\"this requires among other things that the provider does not modify the information that it transmits\",\"if the model is used to make predictions or classifications about individual people then it is very likely that personal data will be used at both the training and inference phases\",\"under data protection law individuals have a number of rights relating to their personal data\",\"ensuring the exclusion of unnecessary data will help prevent the system from identifying unhelpful correlations\",\"that persons review should also include an assessment of all relevant data including any information an individual may provide\",\"you therefore still need to consider this data when you are responding to individuals requests to exercise their rights\",\"data should only be collected or used for the purposes of training or testing machine learning models if such collection and use is legal and consistent with the expectations of the people whose data is collected\",\"data collection should be minimized and clearly communicated to the people whose data is collected\",\"however you should note that pseudonymisation is essentially a security and risk reduction technique and data protection law still applies to personal data that has undergone pseudonymisation\",\"but if the model is trained on a vulnerable or sensitive population eg patients with dementia or hiv then merely revealing that someone is part of that population may be a serious privacy risk\",\"data subject rights can be specified in materials that are publicly available to data subjects such as privacy notices or participant information and organisations should have appropriate mechanisms to delete or withdraw data as required\",\"for example the more things you want to do with the data the more difficult it is to ensure that consent is genuinely specific and informed\",\"in any case if you have a major project that involves the use of personal data it is also good practice to do a dpia\",\"another way to minimise the personal data involved in prediction is to host the ml model on the device from which the query is generated and which already collects and stores the individuals personal data\",\"the privacy of this data and use of this data in a responsible manner is also important\",\"ultimately it is necessary for you to assess the risks to individual rights that your use of ai

no way involved with the information transmitted\",\"this directive should not harmonisegeneral aspects of civil liability which are regulated in different ways by national civilliability rules such as the definition of fault or causality the different types of damagethat give rise to claims for damages the distribution of liability over multipletortfeasors contributory conduct the calculation of damages or limitation periods\",\"to maintain the balance between the interests of the parties involved in the claim fordamages and of third parties concerned the courts should order the disclosure ofevidence only where this is necessary and proportionate for supporting the claim orpotential claim for damages\",\"in particular it establishesa framework for the conditional exemption from liability of providers of intermediary servicesrules on specific due diligence obligations tailored to certain specific categories of providers of intermediary servicesrules on the implementation and enforcement of this regulation including as regards the cooperation of and coordination between the competent authorities\",\"the choice of suitable legal tools is limited given the nature of the burden of proof issue andthe specific characteristics of ai that pose a problem for existing liability rules\",\"suchdisclosure should only be ordered where the potential claimant presents facts andinformation sufficient to support the plausibility of a claim for damages and it hasmade a prior request to the provider the person subject to the obligations of a provideror the user to disclose such evidence at their disposal about specific high risk aisystems that are suspected of having caused damage which has been refused\",\"the specificcharacteristics of ai including complexity autonomy and opacity the so called black boxeffect may make it difficult or prohibitively expensive for victims to identify the liableperson and prove the requirements for a successful liability claim\",\"the aida defines harm as  physical or psychological harm to an individual  damage to an individuals property or  economic loss to an individual\",\"the large number of people usually involved in the design development deploymentand operation of high risk ai systems makes it difficult for injured persons to identifythe person potentially liable for damage caused and to prove the conditions for a claimfor damages\",\"national courts shall limit the disclosure of evidence to that which is necessary andproportionate to support a potential claim or a claim for damages and thepreservation to that which is necessary and proportionate to support such a claim fordamages\",\"while in a fault based claim the claimant usually has toprove the damage the human act or omission constituting fault of the defendant andthe causality link between the two this directive does not harmonise the conditionsunder which national courts establish fault\",\"this directive does not apply retroactively but only to claims for compensation of damagesthat occur as from the date of its transposition\",\"given the large divergence between member statesexisting civil liability rules it is likely that any national ai specific measure on liabilitywould follow existing different national approaches and therefore increase fragmentation\",\"in determining whether an order for the disclosure or preservation of evidence isproportionate national courts shall consider the legitimate interests of all partiesincluding third parties concerned in particular in relation to the protection of tradesecrets within the meaning of article  of directive eu  and ofconfidential information such as information related to public or national security\",\"for example if a firm obstructs attempts to verify whether they have complied with their obligations or provides false or misleading information they could be subject to prosecution\",\"the economicstudyunderpinning the impact assessment of this proposal concluded  as a conservativeestimate  that targeted harmonisation measures on civil liability for ai would have a positiveimpact of  to   on the production value of relevant cross border trade as compared to thebaseline scenario\",\"paragraphs  and  differentiate between on the one hand claims brought against theprovider of a high risk ai system or against a person subject to the providers obligationsunder the ai act and on the other hand claims brought against the user of such systems\",\"such adaptations should also maintain trust in the judicial system by ensuring thatvictims of damage caused with the involvement of ai have the same effectivecompensation as victims of damage caused by other technologies\",\"the application of the presumption of causality is meant to ensure for the injuredperson a similar level of protection as for situations where ai is not involved andwhere causality may therefore be easier to prove\",\"ai harms for example vary by context where they might be already addressed by particular sectoral laws\",\"moreoverfrom the various tools available in national law for easing the burden of proof this proposalhas chosen to use rebuttable presumptions as the least interventionist tool\",\"the competent authorities should in principle take all relevant facts and circumstances of the case into account including information gathered by competent authorities in other member states\",\"hence thesenational tools constitute helpful reference points on how to address the issues raised by ai forexisting liability rules in a way which interferes as little as possible with the different nationallegal regimes\",\"moreover ai providers will be obliged to inform national competent authorities about serious incidents or malfunctioning that constitute a breach of fundamental rights obligations as soon as they become aware of them as well as any recalls or withdrawals of ai systems from the market\",\"in the absence of eu harmonised rules for compensating damage caused by ai systemsproviders operators and users of ai systems on the one hand and injured persons on the otherhand would be faced with  different liability regimes leading to different levels ofprotection and distorted competition among businesses from different member states\",\"the requests should be supported by facts and evidencesufficient to establish the plausibility of the contemplated claim for damages and therequested evidence should be at the addressees disposal\",\"targeted measures to ease the burden of proof in form of rebuttable presumptions werechosen as pragmatic and appropriate ways to help victims meet their burden of proof in themost targeted and proportionate manner possible\",\"to allow injured persons to ascertain whether a claim for damages iswell founded it is appropriate to grant potential claimants a right to request a court toorder the disclosure of relevant evidence before submitting a claim for damages\",\"those services too can benefit from the exemptions from liability to the extent that they qualify as mere conduit caching or hosting service\",\"such presumptionsare commonly found in national liability systems and they balance the interests of claimantsand defendants\",\"therefore a targeted rebuttable presumption ofcausality has been laid down in article   regarding this causal link\",\"nevertheless alleviating the burdenof proving causation is not always appropriate under this directive where thedefendant is not a professional user but rather a person using the ai system for itsprivate activities\",\"even when fault consisting of a non compliance with a duty of care directly intendedto protect against the damage that occurred is established not every fault should leadto the application of the rebuttable presumption linking it to the output of the ai\",\"under such rules victimsneed to prove a wrongful action or omission by a person who caused the damage\",\"users will have access to dispute resolution mechanisms in their own country\",\"this proposal in particular its article  leaves this case law unaffected\",\"subject to the requirements laid down in this article national courts shall presumefor the purposes of applying liability rules to a claim for damages the causal linkbetween the fault of the defendant and the output produced by the ai system or thefailure of the ai system to produce an output where all of the following conditionsare met the claimant has demonstrated or the court has presumed pursuant to article the fault of the defendant or of a person for whose behaviour the defendant isresponsible consisting in the non compliance with a duty of care laid down in unionor national law directly intended to protect against the damage that occurred it can be considered reasonably likely based on the circumstances of the case thatthe fault has influenced the output produced by the ai system or the failure of the aisystem to produce an output the claimant has demonstrated that the output produced by the ai system or thefailure of the ai system to produce an output gave rise to the damage\",\"moreover for high risk ai systems the aiact provides for specific documentation information and logging requirements butdoes not provide a right to the injured person to access that information\",\"it can be for example considered reasonably likely that thefault has influenced the output or failure to produce an output when that fault consistsin breaching a duty of care in respect of limiting the perimeter of operation of the aisystem and the damage occurred outside the perimeter of operation\",\"in the case of a claim for damages concerning an ai system that is not a high risk aisystem the presumption laid down in paragraph  shall only apply where thenational court considers it excessively difficult for the claimant to prove the causallink mentioned in paragraph\",\"in the latter caseit is possible to trace back the damage to a human act or omission as the ai systemoutput is not interposed between the human act or omission and the damage andthereby establishing causality is not more difficult than in situations where an aisystem is not involved\",\"article  indicates the subject matter and scope of this directive it applies to non contractualcivil law claims for damages caused by an ai system where such claims are brought underfault based liability regimes\",\"when an injured person seeks compensation for damage suffered member statesgeneral fault based liability rules usually require that person to prove a negligent orintentionally damaging act or omission fault by the person potentially liable for thatdamage as well as a causal link between that fault and the relevant damage\",\"it alsoreduces legal uncertainty of businesses developing or using ai regarding their possibleexposure to liability and prevents the emergence of fragmented ai specific adaptations ofnational civil liability rules\",\"with this proposal the commission aims to ensure that victims of damage caused by ai havean equivalent level of protection under civil liability rules as victims of damage causedwithout the involvement of ai\",\"the defendant shall have the right to rebut the presumption laid down in paragraph\",\"in a representative survey of liability ranked amongst the top three barriers to the use of ai by european companies\",\"the existing significant divergences between member states liability frameworks are anotherreason why a recommendation is unlikely to be implemented in a consistent manner\",\"member states may establish out of court dispute settlement bodies for the purposes of paragraph  or support the activities of some or all out of court dispute settlement bodies that they have certified in accordance with paragraph\",\"while at the same timethe revision of council directive eec seeks to clarify and ensure that injuredperson can claim compensation for damages caused by defective ai enabled productsit should therefore be clarified that the provisions of this directive do not affect anyrights which an injured person may have under national rules implementing directiveeec\",\"it can be challenging for claimants to establish a causal link between such non complianceand the output produced by the ai system or the failure of the ai system to produce an outputthat gave rise to the relevant damage\",\"in such cases the level of redress afforded by national civil liability rules may belower than in cases where technologies other than ai are involved in causing damage\",\"forthese businesses it is essential to know the relevant liability risks and to be able to insurethemselves against them\",\"the purpose of this directive is to contribute to the proper functioning of the internalmarket by harmonising certain national non contractual fault based liability rules soas to ensure that persons claiming compensation for damage caused to them by an aisystem enjoy a level of protection equivalent to that enjoyed by persons claimingcompensation for damage caused without the involvement of an ai system\",\"harm includes physical harm psychological harm damage to property or economic loss to an individual\",\"subrogation is the assumption by a third party such as an insurance company ofanother partys legal right to collect a debt or damages\",\"therefore where a defendant in a claim for damages fails todisclose evidence at its disposal ordered by a court it is appropriate to lay down apresumption of non compliance with those duties of care which that evidence wasintended to prove\",\"moreover to ensurea proportionate application of a disclosure measure towards third parties in claims fordamages the national courts should order disclosure from third parties only if theevidence cannot be obtained from the defendant\",\"the input from the expert group report was complemented by three additional externalstudies a comparative law study based on a comparative legal analysis of european tortlaws focused on key ai related issues a behavioural economics study on the impacts of targeted adaptations of theliability regime on consumers decision making in particular their trust andwillingness to take up ai enabled products and services an economic study covering a number of issues the challenges faced byvictims of ai applications compared to victims of non ai devices when tryingto obtain compensation for their loss whether and to what extent businessesare uncertain about the application of current liability rules to their operationsinvolving ai and whether the impact of legal uncertainty can hamperinvestment in ai whether further fragmentation of national liability lawswould reduce the effectiveness of the internal market for ai applications andservices and whether and to what extent harmonising certain aspects ofnational civil liability via eu legislation would reduce these problems andfacilitate the overall uptake of ai technology by eu companies\",\"choice of instrumenta directive is the most suitable instrument for this proposal as it provides the desiredharmonisation effect and legal certainty while also providing the flexibility to enable memberstates to embed the harmonised measures without friction into their national liability regimes\",\"it builds on the substantive conditions of liability currently existing in nationalrules such as causality or fault but focuses on targeted proof related measures ensuring thatvictims have the same level of protection as in cases not involving ai systems\",\"in the case of a claim for damages against a defendant who used the ai system in thecourse of a personal non professional activity the presumption laid down inparagraph  shall apply only where the defendant materially interfered with theconditions of the operation of the ai system or if the defendant was required and ableto determine the conditions of operation of the ai system and failed to do so\",\"it is thusnecessary to provide for the conditions under which such third parties to the claim canbe ordered to disclose the relevant evidence\",\"according to article  the claimant can request the disclosure of evidence from providersor users that are not defendants only in case all proportionate attempts were unsuccessfullymade to gather the evidence from the defendant\",\"three policy options were assessedpolicy option  three measures to ease the burden of proof for victims trying to prove theirliability claim\",\"sharing of information on incidents and malfunctioning\",\"in the context of a claim for damages the national court shall only order thedisclosure of the evidence by one of the persons listed in paragraph  if the claimanthas undertaken all proportionate attempts at gathering the relevant evidence from thedefendant\",\"verification costs could amount to another eur   to eur   for suppliers of high risk ai\",\"the conditions and requirements laid down in this article shall be without prejudice to requirements under national criminal procedural law in conformity with union law\",\"such fault can be established for example for non compliance with a dutyof care pursuant to the ai act or pursuant to other rules set at union level such as thoseregulating the use of automated monitoring and decision making for platform work or thoseregulating the operation of unmanned aircraft\",\"if the provider of an ai system has complied with all itsobligations and in consequence that system was deemed sufficiently safe to be put onthe market for a given use by non professional users and it is then used for that task apresumption of causality should not apply for the simple launch of the operation ofsuch a system by such non professional users\",\"in addition this directive should only cover claims for damages when the damage iscaused by an output or the failure to produce an output by an ai system through thefault of a person for example the provider or the user under the ai act\",\"consider seeking legal advice or other expertise\",\"this directive applies to non contractual fault based civil law claims for damages incases where the damage caused by an ai system occurs after the end of thetransposition period\",\"this means namely regimes that provide for a statutoryresponsibility to compensate for damage caused intentionally or by a negligent act oromission\",\"thus this presumption can apply for example in a claimfor damages for physical injury when the court establishes the fault of the defendantfor non complying with the instructions of use which are meant to prevent harm tonatural persons\",\"federal law requires employers and any consultants they may retain to report the costs of surveilling employees in the context of a labor dispute providing a transparency mechanism to help protect worker organizing\",\"therefore adaptations of liability rules taken on a purely national basis would increase thebarriers to the rollout of ai enabled products and services across the internal market andcontribute further to fragmentation\",\"those rules are without prejudice to any possibility to hold the persons engaged in misuse liable including for damages provided for in union or national law\",\"in addition there are concrete signs that a number of member states are considering unilaterallegislative measures to address the specific challenges posed by ai with respect to liability\",\"this will cause legal uncertainty\",\"the preparatorywork started in  with the setting up of the expert group on liability and newtechnologies new technologies formation\",\"potential claimant means a natural or legal person who is considering but has not yetbrought a claim for damages defendant means the person against whom a claim for damages is brought duty of care means a required standard of conduct set by national or union law inorder to avoid damage to legal interests recognised at national or union law levelincluding life physical integrity property and the protection of fundamental rights\",\"the results of the multi criteriaand sensitivity analysis show that policy option  easing the burden of proof for ai relatedclaims  targeted review regarding strict liability possibly coupled with mandatory insuranceranks highest and is therefore the preferred policy choice for this proposal\",\"strict liability was considered disproportionate by the majority of businessrespondents\",\"it is therefore necessary to harmonise in a targeted manner specific aspects of fault based liability rules at union level\",\"in order to address the difficulties to prove that a specific input for which thepotentially liable person is responsible had caused a specific ai system output that ledto the damage at stake it is appropriate to provide under certain conditions for apresumption of causality\",\"it does so by ensuring victims of damage caused by aiobtain equivalent protection to victims of damage caused by products in general\",\"in particular it may be excessively difficult toprove that a specific input for which the potentially liable person is responsible hadcaused a specific ai system output that led to the damage at stake\",\"such presumption isthe least burdensome measure to address the need for fair compensation of the victim\",\"the supply of incorrect incomplete or misleading information to notified bodies and national competent authorities in reply to a request shall be subject to administrative fines of up to    eur or if the offender is a company up to   of its total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year whichever is higher\",\"this could be the case for example in respect of high risk ai systems where theclaimant could reasonably access sufficient evidence and expertise throughdocumentation and logging requirements pursuant to the ai act\",\"the second stage included in the proposal ensures that when assessing the effect of the firststage in terms of victim protection and uptake of ai future technological regulatory andjurisprudential developments will be taken into account when re assessing the need toharmonise other elements of the claims for compensation or other tools related to liabilityclaims including for situations where strict liability would be more appropriate as requestedby the european parliament\",\"article disclosure of evidence and rebuttable presumption of non compliance\",\"member states shall ensure that national courts are empowered either upon therequest of a potential claimant who has previously asked a provider a person subjectto the obligations of a provider pursuant to article  or article  of the ai actor a user to disclose relevant evidence at its disposal about a specific high risk aisystem that is suspected of having caused damage but was refused or a claimant toorder the disclosure of such evidence from those persons\",\"such fault can also be presumed by the courton the basis of a non compliance with a court order for disclosure or preservation of evidenceunder article\",\"due to the severity of the consequences of conviction for a criminal offence prosecution of these offences requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt not only that a particular act was committed but that it was intentional\",\"in the case of non high risk ai systems article  establishes a condition for theapplicability of the presumption of causality whereby the latter is subject to the courtdetermining that it is excessively difficult for the claimant to prove the causal link\",\"we recommend discussing this with legal advisors\",\"where such arisk materialises damage may still occur\",\"in a cross border context the law applicable to a non contractual liability arisingout of a tort or delict is by default the law of the country in which the damage occurs\",\"this added value would be generated notably through reducedfragmentation and increased legal certainty regarding stakeholders liability exposure\",\"access to information about specific high risk ai systems that are suspected of havingcaused damage is an important factor to ascertain whether to claim compensation andto substantiate claims for compensation\",\"in addition depending on each member states civil lawsystem and traditions victims will be able to claim compensation for damage to other legalinterests such as violations of personal dignity articles  and  of the charter respect forprivate and family life article  the right to equality article  and non discriminationarticle\",\"in fixing the amount of the fine the commission shall have regard to the nature gravity duration and recurrence of the infringement and for fines imposed pursuant to paragraph  the delay caused to the proceedings\",\"this would ensure a consistent minimumlevel of protection for all victims individuals and companies and consistent incentives toprevent damage and ensure accountability\",\"thus beyond the presumptions it establishesthis directive does not affect union or national rules determining for instance which partyhas the burden of proof what degree of certainty is required as regards the standard of proofor how fault is defined\",\"national ai strategies show that several member states are considering or even concretelyplanning legislative action on civil liability for ai\",\"this proposal only introduces alleviations of the burden of proof for the victims of damagecaused by ai systems in claims that can be based on national law or on these other eu laws\",\"thisdirective also covers the cases of users fault when this fault consists in non compliance with certain specific requirements set by the ai act\",\"in case of high risk ai systems as defined by the ai act article  establishes an exceptionfrom the presumption of causality where the defendant demonstrates that sufficient evidenceand expertise is reasonably accessible for the claimant to prove the causal link\",\"this directive does not apply to criminal liability\",\"since this directive introduces a rebuttable presumption the defendant should be ableto rebut it in particular by showing that its fault could not have caused the damage\",\"by complementing these other strands this proposal protects the victims right tocompensation under private law including compensation for fundamental rights breaches\",\"this condition is justified by the need to balance the interests of injuredpersons and non professional users by exempting from the application of the presumption ofcausality the cases in which non professional users do not add risk through their behaviour\",\"it should also be necessary to establish that it canbe considered reasonably likely based on the circumstances of the case that the faulthas influenced the output produced by the ai system or the failure of the ai system toproduce an output\",\"orderingdisclosure should lead to a reduction of unnecessary litigation and avoid costs for thepossible litigants caused by claims which are unjustified or likely to be unsuccessful\",\"in this respect article  of the directive provides that a court may order the disclosure ofrelevant evidence about specific high risk ai systems that are suspected of having causeddamage\",\"in areas not harmonised by union law national law continues to apply and fault isestablished under the applicable national law\",\"national courts should be able in the course of civil proceedings to order thedisclosure or preservation of relevant evidence related to the damage caused by high risk ai systems from persons who are already under an obligation to document orrecord information pursuant to the ai act be they providers persons under the sameobligations as providers or users of an ai system either as defendants or third partiesto the claim\",\"the defendant should be able to rebutthat presumption by submitting evidence to the contrary\",\"this is aprocedural tool relevant only in cases where it is the actual defendant in a claim for damageswho bears the consequences of not complying with a request to disclose or preserve evidence\",\"current national liability rules in particular based on fault are not suited to handling liabilityclaims for damage caused by ai enabled products and services\",\"fundamental rightsone of the most important functions of civil liability rules is to ensure that victims of damagecan claim compensation\",\"there is noneed to cover liability claims when the damage is caused by a human assessmentfollowed by a human act or omission while the ai system only provided informationor advice which was taken into account by the relevant human actor\",\"in case infringements of fundamental rights still happen effective redress for affected persons will be made possible by ensuring transparency and traceability of the ai systems coupled with strong ex post controls\",\"the legal certainty provided by the horizontal framework of conditional exemptions from liability for providers of intermediary services laid down in directive ec has allowed many novel services to emerge and scale up across the internal market\",\"they donot provide for compensation of the injured person for damage caused by an output orthe failure to produce an output by an ai system\",\"such an approachallows claimants in cases of damage caused by ai systems to invoke more favourablerules of national law\",\"in such instances the liability rules of this proposalwill apply\",\"finally the claimant should still be required to prove that theoutput or failure to produce an output gave rise to the damage\",\"recovery and redress if an ai systems performance leads to crystallised risks should firms be required or expected to undo the damage by  reversing decisions made by the model where possible and appropriate andor ii compensating any relevant external parties who suffered damage as a result\",\"a national court should apply the presumption where the claimant is in anexcessively difficult position to prove causation since it is required to explain how theai system was led by the human act or omission that constitutes fault to produce theoutput or the failure to produce an output which gave rise to the damage\",\"as provided in article  first subparagraph the court may order such disclosure only tothe extent necessary to sustain the claim given that the information could be critical evidenceto the injured persons claim in the case of damage that involve ai systems\",\"national competent authorities will then investigate the incidentsor malfunctioning collect all the necessary information and regularly transmit it to the commission with adequate metadata\",\"this proposal covers national liability claims mainly based on the fault of anyperson with a view of compensating any type of damage and any type of victim\",\"the laws of the member states concerning the liability of producers for damagecaused by the defectiveness of their products are already harmonised at union level bycouncil directive eec\",\"in addition article  provides that an action for damages can also be brought bysomeone acting on behalf of one or more injured parties in accordance with union or nationallaw\",\"thus national laws could for example maintain reversals of theburden of proof under national fault based regimes or national no fault liabilityreferred to as strict liability regimes of which there are already a large variety innational laws possibly applying to damage caused by ai systems\",\"among other things a court may order a federal agency to amend or correct an individuals information in its records or award monetary damages if an inaccurate irrelevant untimely or incomplete record results in an adverse determination about an individuals qualifications character rights  opportunities or benefitsnists privacy framework provides a comprehensive detailed and actionable approach for organizations to manage privacy risks\",\"those laws do not however affect member statesrules of contractual or non contractual liability such as warranty fault or strictliability based on other grounds than the defect of the product\",\"the aida defines harm as  physical or psychological harm to an individual  damage to an individuals property or  economic loss to an individual\",\"thispossibility can incentivise defendants to comply with their disclosure obligations withmeasures set by the ai act to ensure a high level of transparency of the ai or withdocumenting and recording requirements\",\"in this respect disclosure should only concern evidencethat is necessary for a decision on the respective claim for damages for example onlythe parts of the relevant records or data sets required to prove non compliance with arequirement laid down by the ai act\",\"this directive covers the fault constituting non compliance with certain listedrequirements laid down in chapters  and  of the ai act for providers and users ofhigh risk ai systems the non compliance with which can lead under certainconditions to a presumption of causality\",\"article rebuttable presumption of a causal link in the case of fault\",\"similarly thisdirective does not harmonise the conditions related to the damage for instance whatdamages are compensable which are also regulated by applicable national and unionlaw\",\"in addition to this the rebuttable presumptionswill give those seeking compensation for damage caused by ai systems a more reasonableburden of proof and a chance to succeed with justified liability claims\",\"in these cases you should examine and test any claims made by third parties as part of the procurement

proceedings compared to cases not involving ai\",\"notified bodies shall take out appropriate liability insurance for their conformity assessment activities unless liability is assumed by the member state concerned in accordance with national law or that member state is directly responsible for the conformity assessment\",\"disclosure of evidence article this directive aims to provide persons seeking compensation for damage caused by high riskai systems with effective means to identify potentially liable persons and relevant evidencefor a claim\",\"at the same time such means serve to

characterised by a significant degree of power imbalance and may lead to surveillance arrest or deprivation of a natural persons liberty as well as other adverse impacts on fundamental rights guaranteed in the charter\",\"for example a facial recognition system could be trained to recognise faces but that functionality could be used for multiple purposes such as preventing crime authentication and tagging friends in a social network\",\"the notion of remote biometric identification system as used in this regulation should be defined functionally as an ai system intended for the identification of natural persons at a distance through the comparison of a persons biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database and without prior knowledge whether the

classifying documents however they can perform at a far higher scale and speed than a human\",\"ethical considerations in the use of machine learning for research and statistics\",\"machine learning models will sometimes perform differently in the real world than they did when being trained and so it is important that models are continuously modelled and audited so that any issues can be identified quickly\",\"ml systems require large sets of training and testing data to be copied and imported from their original context of processing shared and stored in a variety of formats and

in detail elsewhere the interests in training a sufficiently accurate ai system and in reducing the quantity of personal data processed to train that system see how should we balance data minimisation and statistical accuracy\",\"these benefits are largely due to the uplift in predictive power more granular classification and segmentation ability to capture non linear relationships and the ability to analyse larger volumes of data and new data sources such as unstructured and alternative data\",\"machine learning  particularly when using predictive analytics  often involves linking data from multiple sources\",\"if the request is for rectification or erasure of the data this may not be possible without re training the model either with the rectified data or without the erased data or

single more accurate global model without having to share any training data with each other\",\"it is also worth considering how machine learning projects can benefit us and their limitations\",\"n unsupervised learning the objective is to make predictions using data where there are no labels for example pictures\",\"this process of transforming data prior to using it for training a statistical model for example transforming numbers into values between  and  is often referred to as pre processing\",\"this normally happens when a researcher takes a data point out of the training data thinking it is not consequential but this can lead to inaccuracy in the system\",\"using the same example as in the supervised machine learning in this instance a data scientist would feed the system with

used to make classifications or predictions about new data points\",\"this phenomenon is referred to in machine learning as concept  model drift and various methods exist for detecting it\",\"the use of machine learning data in research and statistics provides substantial potential benefits\",\"this means that the model learns without supervision to discover its own patterns and information from the data\",\"currently widely available ai technologies are mostly either supervised unsupervised or reinforcement machine learning\",\"the coronavirus crisis has shown the importance of digital technologies in all aspects of modern life\",\"for example a model for predicting future purchases based on customers purchase history would tend to be more statistically accurate the more customers are included in the training data\",\"modification could involve changing the values of data points belonging to individuals at random known as perturbing or adding noise to the data in a way that preserves some of the statistical properties of those features\",\"machine learning is a subset of ai and refers to the development of digital systems that improve their performance on a given task over time through experience\",\"in addition training machine learning models also has an environmental impact which could be lessened by using pre existing models\",\"when designing and building ml applications data scientists will generally assume that all data used in training testing and operating the system will be aggregated in a centralised way and held in its full and original form by a single entity in multiple places throughout the ai systems lifecycle\",\"for example human readable words are normally translated into a series of numbers called a feature vector\",\"recent advances in machine learning are the result of improvements to algorithms\",\"this guidance is underpinned by these general principles but focuses specifically on ethical considerations relating to machine learning which require us to take particular care\",\"the machine learning techniques that can provide you with the best insight depends on the problem youre trying to solve\",\"any data used as the target of a prediction process should receive particular attention to the quality and validity of the predicted outcome or label to ensure the goal of the automated system is appropriately identified and measured\",\"writing and training algorithms can take a lot of time and computational power\",\"supervised learning leads to a prediction or classification of a known quantity ie an outcome variable using patterns that the machine finds in the data to predict an outcome\",\"due to an unsafe default configuration an attacker introduced and executed malicious code remotely on the system by disguising it as training data\",\"sometimes it may be necessary to retain training data in order to re train the model for example when new modelling approaches become available and for debugging\",\"the information collected from machine learning can be descriptive it uses data to explain a phenomenon\",\"this could be because no high quality test data exists or because what you are trying to predict or classify is subjective eg whether a social media post is offensive\",\"unsupervised learning which is training an ai algorithm to use unlabelled and unclassified information\",\"there are certain types of problems for which machine learning is commonly used\",\"generally speaking you can choose how much noise to inject with obvious consequences for how much you can still learn from the noisy data\",\"an early demonstration of this kind of attack concerned a medical model designed to predict the correct dosage of an anticoagulant using patient data including genetic biomarkers\",\"commercial experience of ai understanding of machine learning techniques and algorithms including production deployments at scale\",\"have the limitations of machine learning datatechnologies been considered\",\"for example making more statistically accurate and non discriminatory ml models\",\"in order for the training to be effective it is important that human reviewers have the authority to override the output generated by the ai system and they are confident that they will not be penalised for so doing\",\"aside from svms and other models that contain examples from the training data by design some models might leak personal data by accident\",\"for example in the training data for a banks credit risk ml model the predictor variables might include the age income occupation and location of previous customers while the target variable will be whether or not the customers repaid their loan\",\"recent advances in machine learning are the result of improvements to algorithms increases in funding huge growth in the amount of data created and stored by digital systems increased access to computational power and the expansion of cloud computing\",\"maintaining the provenance of training data and supporting attribution of the ai systems decisions to subsets of training data can assist with both transparency and accountability\",\"the algorithm then used this information to predict the population density of an area\",\"to make a prediction or classification about an individual ml models usually require the full set of predictor variables for that person to be included in the query\",\"there are a variety of standard feature selection methods used by data scientists to select features which will be useful for inclusion in a model\",\"when creating or using ml models you invariably need to obtain data to train those models\",\"in this guidance we refer to all those interacting with machine learning as stakeholders however it is important for researchers to consider who these different stakeholders are and tailor communication with each group for best impact\",\"the test data is usually separated from the training data prior to training or drawn from a different source or both\",\"in reinforcement learning the objective is to make predictions which accomplish a specific goal\",\"depending on the particular programming library in which the ml model is implemented there may be a built in function to easily retrieve these examples\",\"the model also used data from micro censuses to validate its outputs and provide valuable training data for the model\",\"overfitting can happen where there are too many features included or where there are too few examples in the training data or both\",\"helpfulwhat is machine learning\",\"recent advances in machine learning such as deep learning have made it even easier for ai systems to detect patterns in the world that are reflected in seemingly unrelated data\",\"that is the more likely it will capture any underlying statistically useful relationships between the features in the datasets\",\"you may want to break up your discovery into smaller phases so you can evaluate what you are learning\",\"for example pre trained models and transfer learning can advance research and increase accuracy and resilience when compared to other models and approaches\",\"the proposal for a machinery regulation which is adopted on the same day as this proposal fully reflects this approach\",\"similarly various methods exist to create ml models which optimise statistical accuracy while also minimising mathematically defined measures of discrimination\",\"supervised ml approaches therefore use data in two main phases the training phase when training data is used to develop models based on past examples\",\"this will enable assurance that the machine learning technique fulfils the intended purpose without any unwanted consequences\",\"in general when an ai system learns from data as is the case with ml models the more data it is trained on the more statistically accurate it will be\",\"machine learning application natural language processing nlp computer vision anomaly detection time series analysis recommender systems\",\"the department for international development partnered with the university of southampton columbia university and the united nations population fund to apply a random forest machine learning algorithm to satellite image and micro census data\",\"similarly the machine learning community has proposed model cards and datasheets which describe how ml models may perform under different conditions and the context behind the datasets they are trained on which may help inform an impact assessment\",\"for example it can provide more accurate information forecasts and predictions leading to better outcomes for example more accurate medical diagnoses\",\"many modern ml methods are more powerful than traditional statistical approaches because they are better at uncovering non linear patterns in high dimensional data\",\"the training should reoccur regularly to ensure it is up to date with the system and to ensure the system is used appropriately\",\"to do this the ai model is trained against a dataset a training set a subset to train the model and a test set a subset to test the trained model\",\"however users integrate the functions the process should be iterative with cross referencing between functions as necessary\",\"use of pre trained models that can advance research and improve performance can also increase levels of statistical uncertainty and cause issues with bias management scientific validity and reproducibility\",\"and any new features added to an existing dataset may be relevant to what the model is trying to predict\",\"machine learning is a subset of ai and refers to the development of digital systems that improve their performance on a given task over time through experience\",\"in addition to summaries of individual predictions limes can sometimes help detect errors eg to see what specific part of an image has led a model to classify it incorrectly\",\"the potential biases associated with machine learning are not unique to machine learning methods for example sample bias is a typical ethical and quality consideration within traditional statistical methods and mitigations used to limit bias in traditional statistical methods can certainly help when thinking about machine learning\",\"machine learning is the most widely used form of ai and has contributed to innovations like self driving cars speech recognition and machine translation\",\"the cma published a paper on algorithms how they can reduce competition and harm consumers and an accompanying call for information in january\",\"machine learning is a sub branch of ai\",\"it proved that an attacker with access to some demographic information about the individuals included in the training data could infer their genetic biomarkers from the model despite not having access to the underlying training data\",\"for example you may think it more important to rectify an incorrectly recorded customer delivery address than to rectify the same incorrect address in training data\",\"there is a risk that this fails to comply with the data minimisation principle\",\"these methods are good practice in data science but they also go some way towards meeting the data minimisation principle\",\"of course despite these ethical considerations there are huge benefits to using machine learning methods\",\"training data is also typically subjected to various measures to make it more amenable to ml algorithms\",\"these are examples fed to an ml model which have been deliberately modified so that they are reliably misclassified\",\"specifically the training data contains both the target variable ie the thing that the model is aiming to predict or classify and several predictor variables ie the input used to make the prediction\",\"in cases where the training data reflects past discrimination you could either modify the data change the learning process or modify the model after training\",\"reinforcement learning which allows an ai model to learn as it performs a task\",\"this is not a far fetched example in january of  such a vulnerability was discovered in numpy a popular library for the python programming language used by many machine learning developers\",\"some of these techniques involve modifying the training data to reduce the extent to which it can be traced back to specific individuals while retaining its use for the purposes of training well performing models\",\"training validation and testing data sets shall be subject to appropriate data governance and management practices\",\"for example if  of all emails received to an inbox are spam then you could create a  accurate classifier by simply labelling everything as spam\",\"machine learning can be supervised learning which allows an ai model to learn from labelled training data for example training a model to help tag content on gov uk\",\"helpfulwhat training data was used to teach the system\",\"any training programme is kept up to date in line with technological developments and changes in processes with human reviewers being offered refresher training at intervals where appropriate\",\"it is important for all stakeholders to understand that they are interacting with machine learning and the conclusions and recommendations that come from a machine learning model\",\"how did you train the system which methods did you use throughout the process\",\"in this example if a customer provided a list of their recent purchases as part of their request the organisation may be able to identify the portion of the training data that relates to them\",\"for example it can provide more accurate information forecasts and predictions leading to better outcomes for example more accurate medical diagnoses\",\"if a model does not outperform human performance it still may be useful\",\"not helpfulwhat will the typical lay person learn from being presented with an algorithm\",\"ml systems make predictions or classifications about people based on data patterns\",\"however you will generally need to process some real data in order to determine realistic parameters for the synthetic data\",\"this allows the attacker to infer that the person was in the training data\",\"cyberattacks against ai systems can leverage ai specific assets such as training data sets eg\",\"predictive it predicts what will happen based on trends and patterns from the data given\",\"examples include using natural language processing to generate insights from unstructured text documentation predictive analytics to forecast where risks may lie across our supervisory waterfront and simulation techniques to generate realistic synthetic data sets\",\"to get responses a classification of objects in the image\",\"examples of machine learning projects in research and statistics include using satellite data to estimate land coverage and land usage\",\"for example if a data scientist wanted to teach a system to identify cats in different images they would feed the system with images of cats labelled as cats\",\"training a machine learning model can take anywhere between hours and months depending on the problem you are trying to solve and the data being used\",\"the algorithms are robust unbiased fair and explainable\",\"although data would be less accurate at individual level provided the system has enough users you could still observe patterns and use these to train your ml model at an aggregate level\",\"training data may also be subject to copyright and should follow applicable intellectual property rights laws\",\"so pre processing in machine learning terminology is still processing in data protection terminology and therefore data protection still applies\",\"training validation and testing data sets shall be relevant representative free of errors and complete\",\"data that is derived from other data through the use of algorithms such as data derived or inferred from prior model outputs should be identified and tracked eg via a specialized type in a data schema\",\"where your system is based on ml this might involve including the corrected decisions into fresh training data so that similar mistakes are less likely to happen in future\",\"avoiding such re identification may require you to change your synthetic data to the extent that it would be too unrealistic to be useful for machine learning purposes\",\"these allow one party to retrieve a prediction or classification without revealing all of this information to the party running the model in simple terms they allow you to get an answer without having to fully reveal the question\",\"complying with a request to erase training data does not entail erasing all ml models based on this data unless the models themselves contain that data or can be used to infer it\",\"for example a retailer creating a model to predict consumer purchases based on past transactions needs a large dataset of customer transactions to train the model on\",\"we can benefit greatly from considering these principles in relation to machine learning and the ethical issues addressed below\",\"machine learning can be supervised learning which allows an ai model to learn from labelled training data for example training an ai model to help tag content on gov uk\",\"are you able to explain what data is being used to train the algorithm and what you expect to get from the data afterwards\",\"methods and quality is machine learning the most suitable method to use\",\"for example the training data may be incomplete or unrepresentative of the correct population\",\"by using machine learning analysts are able to identify trends and patterns in very large datasets\",\"for example smartphone predictive text systems are based on the words that users have previously typed\",\"for example whilst machine learning algorithms can help us make predictions most are not causal\",\"federated learning is relatively new but has several large scale applications\",\"the data science campus present methods for cleaning faulty data to improve reliability and accuracy in their research on estimating vehicle and pedestrian activity from town and city traffic cameras which provides an interesting example of machine learning being used for statistical purposes\",\"again whilst there may be some overlapping relevance to operational or other uses of machine learning this guidance focuses on the implications of different ethical challenges for research and statistics\",\"if an individual was in the training data then the model will be disproportionately confident in a prediction about that person because it has seen them before\",\"so called black box algorithms where the researcher knows what data is fed into the algorithm and what comes out but might not be able to interpret it in actionable human terms are central to considering this issue\",\"this is a phenomenon in ai known as concept drift\",\"in this section we explore some of the most relevant techniques for supervised machine learning ml systems which are currently the most common type of ai in use\",\"this type of machine learning assists us in finding unknown patterns in data\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"ML

narrative\",\"if the outputs of ai systems are not easily interpretable and other explanation tools are not available or reliable there is a risk that a human is not able to meaningfully assess the output of an ai system and factor it into their own decision making\",\"the core issues regarding ai and the transparency principle are addressed in explaining decisions made with ai guidance so are not discussed in detail here\",\"explainability and transparency are important considerations for researchers to build public confidence and promote ethical practice\",\"ensure explainability\",\"as transparency tools for ai systems and related documentation continue to evolve developers of ai systems are encouraged to test different types of transparency tools in cooperation with ai deployers to ensure that ai systems are used as intended\",\"this means that conclusions can rarely be drawn that are beyond correlation therefore it is often not possible to make claims of cause and effect\",\"such meaningful access should include but is not limited to adhering to the principle on notice and explanation using the highest level of risk so the system is designed with built in explanations such systems should use fully transparent models where the model itself can be understood by people needing to directly examine it\",\"communicating with non experts when using machine learning techniques to ensure transparency\",\"improving understanding of limitations in ai and ml processes\",\"however theclaimant should neither be required to explain the characteristics of the ai systemconcerned nor how these characteristics make it harder to establish the causal link\",\"there are many different stakeholders that need to be considered when thinking about transparency and communicating your research from members of the public to internal and external analysts\",\"by assessing necessity in a dpia you can evidence that you couldnt accomplish these purposes in a less intrusive way\",\"a positive opinion should be accompanied by comments where the auditor wishes to include remarks that do not have a substantial effect on the outcome of the audit\",\"assessing the interpretability requirements should be part of the design phase allowing you to develop explanation tools as part of the system if required\",\"this includes a level of interpretability appropriate to the context\",\"the explanation provided by a system should accurately reflect the factors and the influences that led to a particular decision and should be meaningful for the particular customization based on purpose target and level of risk\",\"the lack of a timely explanation made it harder to understand and contest the decision\",\"the information provided should be sufficient to allow the public to understand the capabilities limitations and potential impacts of the systems\",\"however it is difficult to determine whether an opaque system possesses such characteristics and to do so over time as complex systems evolve\",\"while the explaining decisions made with ai guidance already covers the challenge of ai explainability for individuals in substantial detail this guidance includes some additional considerations about ai explainability within the organisation eg for internal oversight and compliance\",\"in some other areas a ground truth may be unattainable\",\"explanations should be targeted to specific audiences and clearly state that audience\",\"explainability refers to a representation of the mechanisms underlying ai systems operation whereas interpretability refers to the meaning of ai systems output in the context of their designed functional purposes\",\"yet several key differences can be seen even between the seemingly similar approaches outlined above\",\"transparency obligations for certain ai systems\",\"how much better is this approach than others that could have been used\",\"however they do not represent the logic underlying the ai system and its outputs and can be misleading if misused especially with certain kinds of models eg high dimensional models\",\"however the manner in which this should be achieved is not elaborated\",\"make sure data is clearly labelled as inferences and predictions and is not claimed to be factual\",\"it should also be relatively easy for a human reviewer to identify and rectify any mistake if a decision is challenged by an individual because of a systems high interpretability\",\"where appropriate based on the explanatory system error ranges for the explanation should be calculated and included in the explanation with the choice of presentation of such information balanced with usability and overall interface complexity concerns\",\"various pieces of guidance have also been produced that apply to the private sector for instance ico guidance on explaining ai decision making or using facial recognition technology in public spaces\",\"explainability can answer the question of how a decision was made in the system\",\"however such a description is necessary as part of a dpia\",\"at the same time mrm regulation does not explicitly mention ai and there is currently no explicit guidance on issues like model explainabilityinterpretability of ai models\",\"explanations and documentation of risks based on empirical evidence of incidents\",\"an appropriate type and degree of transparency shall be ensured with a view to achieving compliance with the relevant obligations of the user and of the provider set out in chapter  of this title\",\"tolimit the disclosure to the necessary minimum and prevent blanket requests\",\"explainability then can be used to define machine learning techniques that as humans we are adequately able to understand trust and manage\",\"striking the appropriate balance between explainability and statistical accuracy security and commercial secrecy see the explaining decisions made with ai guidance and what about ai security risks exacerbated by explainable ai\",\"this means that the outputs of ai models such as predictions and classifications about individuals are out of scope of the right to portability\",\"further users who use an ai system to generate or manipulate image audio or video content that appreciably resembles existing persons places or events and would falsely appear to a person to be authentic should disclose that the content has been artificially created or manipulated by labelling the artificial intelligence output accordingly and disclosing its artificial origin\",\"a multidisciplinary team of researchers aims to develop measurement methods and best practices to support the implementation of core tenets of explainable ai\",\"for the purposes of this framework explanation should be construed broadly\",\"however interpretability is challenging to define in absolute terms and can be measured in different ways\",\"the discussion paper will explain if responses will be shared with other organisations\",\"as part of the governments ai sector deal in collaboration with the alan turing institute the turing we have produced guidance on how organisations can best explain their use of ai to individuals\",\"explanations should be tailored to the specific purpose for which the user is expected to use the explanation and should clearly state that purpose\",\"this section provides a brief summary of the problems which the principle seeks to address and protect against including illustrative examples\",\"transparency is often necessary for actionable redress related to ai system outputs that are incorrect or otherwise lead to negative impacts\",\"notices and explanations may need to be available in multiple forms eg on paper on a physical sign or online in order to meet these expectations and to be accessible to the american public\",\"they should clearly present the main parameters for such recommender systems in an easily comprehensible manner to ensure that the recipients understand how information is prioritised for them\",\"in that context it shall inform the notified body concerned about the objections raised and give it the possibility to make its views known\",\"an explanation of the outputs and any associated recommendations arising from the project should be easily accessible and as understandable as possible supporting non expert understanding of the impact of the research findings\",\"the lack of notice or an explanation makes it harder for those performing child maltreatment assessments to validate the risk assessment and denies parents knowledge that could help them contest a decision\",\"what information might your audience find helpful\",\"individualized profile information should be made readily available to the greatest extent possible that includes explanations for any system impacts or inferences\",\"discovery can help you understand the problem that needs to be solved\",\"however other systems such as those based on ml may be more complex and present more challenges for meaningful human review\",\"thoroughly understand the problem and the needs of different users\",\"transparency\",\"instead they are intended to represent a statistically informed guess as to something which may be true about the individual now or in the future\",\"recent research has demonstrated how some proposed methods to make ml models explainable can unintentionally make it easier to conduct privacy attacks on models\",\"for example models that use a small number of human interpretable features eg age and weight are likely to be easier to interpret than models that use a large number of features\",\"how have you arrived at these findings\",\"this resulted in the explaining decisions made with ai  guidance which was published in may\",\"you should also consider interpretability from the design phase\",\"in many cases the outputs of an ai system are not intended to be treated as factual information about the individual\",\"article transposition\",\"if the choice is taken that an opaque machine learning algorithm is to be used over a more explainable one researchers may need to consider how this can be communicated to a non specialist audience\",\"limitations of the generalizability beyond the conditions under which the technology was developed are documented\",\"in other settings the extent of explanation provided should be tailored to the risk level\",\"it is therefore important that you can describe the processing in a way that those you consult can understand\",\"lack of interpretability\",\"such sources should be carefully validated against the risk of collateral consequences\",\"however the exact information required in these reports is currently unclear\",\"in other cases organizations might face a tradeoff between predictive accuracy and interpretability\",\"while approximation and simplification may be necessary for the system to succeed based on the explanatory purpose and target of the explanation or to account for the risk of fraud or other concerns related to revealing decision making information such simplifications should be done in a scientifically supportable way\",\"consider this from the perspective of the audience you are trying to communicate with\",\"these biases which are not necessarily always harmful may be exacerbated by ai system opacity and the resulting lack of transparency\",\"user experience design choices that intentionally obfuscate or manipulate user choice ie dark patterns should be not be used\",\"are they likely to understand it or is there a more understandable way of presenting this to a lay audience\",\"this is why it is important that you define and document what interpretability means and how to measure it in the specific context of each ai system you wish to use and the personal data that system will process\",\"in cases of high dimensional andor derived attributes such justifications can be provided as overall descriptions of the attribute generation process and appropriateness\",\"review trade offs on a regular basis taking into account among other things the views of individuals or their representatives and any emerging techniques or best practices to reduce them\",\"in some cases insufficient explanations may prompt individuals to resort to other rights unnecessarily\",\"explainability then is not black and white and should be seen more as a sliding scale\",\"how can you present your research findings in a way that is relevant to policy and which clearly highlights its aims its importance its limitations and its implications\",\"please indicate if you regard all or some of the information you provide as confidential\",\"this section provides a brief summary of the problems which the principle seeks to address and protect against including illustrative examples\",\"transparency reflects the extent to which information about an ai system and its outputs is available to individuals interacting with such a system  regardless of whether they are even aware that they are doing so\",\"users should be able to interpret the system output and use it appropriately\",\"these questions should be answered in a transparent and timely manner\",\"better understand our own research\",\"in the context of automated systems clear and valid explanations should be recognized as a baseline requirement\",\"you must also be able to demonstrate the necessity and proportionality of the processing\",\"presenting ai system information to humans is complex\",\"given that the kind of explanations you may need to provide to data subjects about ai need to be in a concise transparent intelligible and easily accessible form using clear and plain language they will not normally risk commercially sensitive information\",\"stakeholders mostly requested a narrow clear and precise definition for ai\",\"though not synonymous issues of transparency and explainability are inextricably linked with one another and so for the purpose of this guidance the two challenges will be addressed together\",\"this is also an example of where you must take into account the accuracy principle  for more information see our guidance on the accuracy principle which refers to accuracy of opinions\",\"anticipate when the system may be misleading or wrong and why\",\"interpretability can answer the question of why a decision was made by the system and its meaning or context to the user\",\"results are documented\",\"take a minute to consider what information you may not find helpful if you were approached by someone who wanted to tell you about their machine learning research from the perspective of the audience you are trying to communicate with\",\"one approach to address low interpretability is the use of local explanations using methods like local interpretable model agnostic explanation lime which provides an explanation of a specific output rather than the model in general\",\"the nature of your relationship with individuals\",\"an explanation provided to the subject of a decision might differ from one provided to an advocate or to a domain expert or decision maker\",\"checking their assumptions about context of use\",\"the brevity clarity and accessibility of the notice and instructions should be assessed eg via user experience research\",\"moreover users perceive there to be a mismatch between providers policies as stated and their concrete actions\",\"another significant challenge raised by ai is explainability\",\"helping users make sure users feel confident in using interpreting and challenging any outputs or insights generated by the model\",\"where appropriate take steps to explain any trade offs to individuals or any human tasked with reviewing ai outputs\",\"express their point of view\",\"the nist is conducting fundamental research on the explainability of ai systems\",\"it is important to tailor your communications with each group to ensure transparency however by considering the questions above in relation to a non expert user you may find it easier to communicate this information to all stakeholders\",\"however many people may not be able to understand or interpret an algorithm\",\"an informational explanation might differ from an explanation provided to allow for the possibility of recourse an appeal or one provided in the context of a dispute or contestation process\",\"an explanation need not be a plain language statement about causality but could consist of any mechanism that allows the recipient to build the necessary understanding and intuitions to achieve the stated purpose\",\"of course there are far greater complexities when it comes to algorithmic explainability than allow us to make binary distinctions between black box algorithms and explainable algorithms and there a number of model agnostic methods which may help researchers in some instances and with certain caveats interpret machine learning models\",\"this section provides a brief summary of the problems which the principle seeks to address and protect against including illustrative examples\",\"as a result the audience of such academic pieces is more restricted\",\"these problems are well documented\",\"the second containing a more high level description of the processing and explaining the logic of how the personal data inputs relate to the outputs affecting individuals this may also support you in fulfilling your obligation to explain ai decisions to individuals\",\"in the absence of robust evidence it is however not possible to draw firm conclusions on the extent of this eu added value\",\"by placing ourselves in the shoes of a person with no knowledge of machine learning or by practicing explaining our work to people with no knowledge of it not only are we able to better communicate with this group of users but we can alsobegin to think more transparently about our work\",\"regular and systematic documentation of all coding processes and decisions made are therefore the building blocks of transparency\",\"if stakeholders from participants to analysts are not given clear information to help them understand the research then this risks promoting harmful practices\",\"these flaws were only revealed when an explanation of the system was demanded and produced\",\"for example when providing an explanation to individuals there may be a risk that doing so reveals proprietary information about how the ai model works\",\"transparency\",\"these factors can make explanations both more challenging and more important and should not be used as a pretext to avoid explaining important decisions to the people impacted by those choices\",\"together explainability and interpretability assist those operating or overseeing an ai system as well as users of an ai system to gain deeper insights into the functionality and trustworthiness of the system including its outputs\",\"the defense advanced research projects agency has a program on explainable artificial intelligence that aims to create a suite of machine learning techniques that produce more explainable models while maintaining a high level of learning performance prediction accuracy and enable human users to understand appropriately trust and effectively manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent partners\",\"some types of ai systems may have outputs which are difficult for a human reviewer to interpret for example those which rely on complex high dimensional deep learning models\",\"approaches are documented\",\"better communicate with a lay audience\",\"we may choose to publish certain responses to this discussion paper to help inform the public debate on artificial intelligence\",\"the model is explainable\",\"to address the opacity that may make certain ai systems incomprehensible to or too complex for natural persons a certain degree of transparency should be required for high risk ai systems\",\"errors may not be easy for a human reviewer to identify understand or fix\",\"in that regard is should be determined objectively on the basis of all relevant circumstances whether the presentation could lead to such a belief on the side of an average and reasonably well informed consumer\",\"how can you present the information in a way that is concise and easy to read or visualise\",\"article statement of reasonswhere a provider of hosting services decides to remove or disable access to specific items of information provided by the recipients of the service irrespective of the means used for detecting identifying or removing or disabling access to that information and of the reason for its decision it shall inform the recipient at the latest at the time of the removal or disabling of access of the decision and provide a clear and specific statement of reasons for that decision\",\"the mere possibility to create groups of users of a given service should not in itself be understood to mean that the information disseminated in that manner is not disseminated to the public\",\"if we receive a request for disclosure of this information we will take your indications into account but cannot give an assurance that confidentiality can be maintained in all circumstances\",\"accessible\",\"however there may be cases where you need to consider the right of individuals to receive an explanation and for example the interests of businesses to maintain trade secrets noting that data protection compliance cannot be traded away\",\"improve the impact of our work on different audiences\",\"transparency can answer the question of what happened in the system\",\"for further guidance on communicating public good see our public good guidance\",\"as a starting point you should train or retrain your human reviewers to understand how an ai system works and its limitations\",\"why is the study important and what will you do with the results\",\"this should be clearly documented\",\"increased opacity and concerns about reproducibility\",\"depending on the question between  and  of the respondents used the free text option to insert comments\",\"those in charge of designing the front end interface of an ai system must understand the needs thought processes and behaviours of human reviewers and allow them to effectively intervene\",\"while these approaches provide theoretical guarantees it can be hard to meaningfully put them into practice\",\"where applicable the factors that must be addressed in the explanation have been expanded to include the type of personal information that was used its source and the reasons or principal factors that led to the prediction recommendation or decision\",\"an independent study showed that the model predictions underperformed relative to the designers claims while also causing alert fatigue by falsely alerting likelihood of sepsis\",\"notices that include the elements referred to in paragraph  shall be considered to give rise to actual knowledge or awareness for the purposes of article  in respect of the specific item of information concerned\",\"tailored to the target of the explanation\",\"notice and explanations also serve an important safety and efficacy purpose allowing experts to verify the reasonableness of a recommendation before enacting it\",\"representing complex human phenomena with mathematical models can come at the cost of removing necessary context\",\"it may put users off if there is too much information or if the information presented is hard to read\",\"the need to consider the transparency and explainability of machine learning research and the implications this has for reproducibility\",\"use clear and plain language that is understandable by a broad audience includingsenior executives government officials non governmental organization leadership and those who are not ai professionals  while still of sufficient technical depth to be useful to practitioners\",\"obtain an explanation about the logic of the decision\",\"researchers using machine learning techniques should communicate in plain language why the opaque algorithm was chosen and what its advantages are that make it the best choice despite the lack of explainability as well as what training data has been used any bias or limitations of the data and whether the training data has been validated through other studies\",\"this section provides a brief summary of the problems which the principle seeks to address and protect against including illustrative examples\",\"humans perceive and derive meaning from ai system output and explanations in different ways reflecting different individual preferences traits and skills\",\"if a system is too complex to explain it may also be too complex to meaningfully contest intervene on review or put an alternative point of view against\",\"provide meaningful explanations for either rejecting or accepting the ai systems output  a decision they should be responsible for\",\"instead a brief high level summary of how you have come to your findings may be more useful\",\"these could include inappropriate model choices errors in the model design or construction lack of explainability unexpected behaviour unintended consequences degradation in model performance model or concept drift and more\",\"the white paper on ai further developed this inclusive approach inciting comments from more than  stakeholders including over  additional position papers\",\"for example a lack of explainability or transparency in some ai models may mean extra care or actions are needed to ensure full accountability and sufficient oversight\",\"domains understood by the public to be sensitive also change over time including because of technological developments\",\"transparency is particularly important to consider when using technologies such as machine learning especially with the aim of reproducibility in mind\",\"transparency should consider human ai interaction\",\"how can you present the information in a way that is concise and easy to read\",\"this means it makes it substantially less certain which words were noise and which words were actually typed by a specific user\",\"risk from lack of explainability may be managed by describing how ai systems function with descriptions tailored to individual differences such as the users role knowledge and skill level\",\"risks to interpretability often can be addressed by communicating a description of why an ai system made a particular prediction or recommendation\",\"understand how their own expertise is meant to complement the system and provide them with a list of factors to take into account\",\"trustworthiness characteristics explained in this document influence each other\",\"demonstrate protections for notice and explanationreporting\",\"summary reporting should document the determinations made based on the above considerations including the responsible entities for accountability purposes the goal and use cases for the system identified users and impacted populations the assessment of notice clarity and timeliness the assessment of the explanations validity and accessibility the assessment of the level of risk and the account and assessment of how explanations are tailored including to the purpose the recipient of the explanation and the level of risk\",\"what information might your audience not find helpful\",\"for example existing frameworks and guidance are unable to adequately manage the problem of harmful bias in ai systems\",\"in our work to date we have developed some indicative example scenarios\",\"there are two broad audiences\",\"however if you can demonstrate that consultation would compromise commercial confidentiality undermine security or be disproportionate or impracticable these can be reasons not to consult\",\"the guidance also assumes familiarity with ai related terms and concepts\",\"moreover the complexity of ai models is increasing which can lead to a lack of explainability or interpretability known as the black box problemfootnote the potential for drift combined with the lack of explainability can in turn lead to a range of prudential risks\",\"inscrutability can be a result of the opaque nature of ai systems limited explainability or interpretability lack of transparency or documentation in ai system development or deployment or inherent uncertainties in ai systems\",\"processes and analyses natural language recognising words their meaning context and the narrative\",\"explainable and interpretable ai systems offer information that will help end users understand the purposes and potential impact of an ai system\",\"researchers might also find it useful to produce a clear statement of why their conclusions are believed to be valid what is meant by being valid for their particular use case and any limitations on the validity\",\"these concepts relate to the potentially opaque nature of machine learning algorithms and the difficulty in communicating how these systems are used and how they work particularly to a lay audience\",\"by promoting higher levels of understanding transparency increases confidence in the ai system\",\"meaningful transparency provides access to appropriate levels of information based on the stage of the ai lifecycle and tailored to the role or knowledge of ai actors or individuals interacting with or using the ai system\",\"making inferences locally\",\"however the human input needs to be meaningful\",\"provide clear timely understandable and accessible notice of use and explanations\",\"explainable systems can be debugged and monitored more easily and they lend themselves to more thorough documentation audit and governance\",\"the icos and the alan turing institutes explaining decisions made with ai guidance looks at how and to what extent complex ai systems might affect your ability to provide meaningful explanations to individuals\",\"a lack of transparency in machine learning projects has further implications for the reproducibility of results\",\"for example the comments section in an online newspaper could constitute such a feature where it is clear that it is ancillary to the main service represented by the publication of news under the editorial responsibility of the publisher\",\"if in doubt assume that the group that you are interacting with has no experience of machine learning  it is better to simplify your language to ensure that stakeholders understand your message\",\"one of the uk statistics authoritys ethical principles   transparency  relates to the obligation of researchers to ensure that the decisions they make about their data analysis and methods are openly and honestly documented and communicated in a way that allows others to evaluate them\",\"techniques used to automate the process of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many forms\",\"the exercise below may help analysts think about these concepts and communicate with users effectively\",\"for example in certain scenarios tradeoffs may emerge between optimizing for interpretability and achieving privacy\",\"in these cases consideration should be given as to how information can be communicated transparently and in ways that are easy to understand to relevant non expert communities as necessary\",\"some ai systems are more interpretable than others\",\"designers and implementers of ai systems should be able to explain to affected stakeholders how and why a model performed the way it did in a specific context\",\"being transparent about the way in which data is used and how our research is carried out allows others to verify the results of a project via replication and the accuracy or inaccuracy of a model enabling researchers to determine whether the model is sufficient and whether it is suitable for further use\",\"you can then tailor your communication with this in mind\",\"diverse teams contribute to more open sharing of ideas and assumptions about the purposes and functions of technology making these implicit aspects more explicit\",\"transparency explainability and interpretability are distinct characteristics that support each other\",\"the section will also explain the importance of identifying and understanding controller processor relationships\",\"particularly the interpretability requirements and effective user interface design to support human reviews and interventions\",\"the lack of an explanation made it harder for errors to be corrected in a timely manner\",\"the bors principles are explicitly framed as an overlapping set of backstops against potential harms while the executive order  emphasises that the benefits of using ai systems must outweigh the risks\",\"documentation can enhance transparency improve human review processes and bolster accountability in ai system teams\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"Explainability, transparency and interpretability of

guidance for any person or entity that creates deploys or oversees automated systems\",\"the technical sustainability of these systems ultimately depends on their safety including their accuracy reliability security and robustness\",\"enabling recognition of when systems are not functional within or out of their in tended context\",\"most federal government entities must comply with an existing directive on automated decision making the directive the objective of which is to ensure such systems are used in a way that reduces associated risks to canadians and federal institutions\",\"examples of automated systems for which the blueprint for an ai bill of rights should be considered include those that have the potential to meaningfully impactcivil rights civil liberties or privacy including but not limited tospeech related systems such as automated content moderation toolssurveillance and criminal justice system algorithms such as risk assessments predictive policing automated license plate readers real time facial recognition systems especially those used in public places or during protected activities like peaceful protests social media monitoring and ankle monitoring devicesvoting related systems such as signature matching toolssystems with a potential privacy impact such as smart home systems and associated data systems that use or collect health related data systems that use or collect education related data criminal justice system data ad targeting systems and systems that perform big data analytics in order to build profiles or infer personal information about individuals andany system that has the meaningful potential to lead to algorithmic discrimination\",\"the decision making processes of automated systems tend to be opaque complex and therefore unaccountable whether by design or by omission\",\"for these reasons the blueprint for an ai bill of rights asserts that the harms of automated systems should be evaluated protected against and redressed at both the individual and community levels\",\"systems should not employ user experience and design decisions that obfuscate user choice or burden users with defaults that are privacy invasive\",\"in many time critical systems such a remedy is already immediately available such as a building manager who can open a door in the case an automated card access system fails\",\"notice should be kept up to date and people impacted by the system should be notified of use case or key functionality changes\",\"in addition to being able to opt out and use a human alternative the american public deserves a human fallback system in the event that an automated system fails or causes harm\",\"it does so by imposing several requirements on the federal governments use of automated decision making technologies and on businesses that licence or sell such technologies to the federal government\",\"the public should be consulted in the design implementation deployment acquisition and maintenance phases of automated system development with emphasis on early stage consultation before a system is introduced or a large change implemented\",\"such notice should be kept up to date and people impacted by the system should be notified of significant use case or key functionality changes\",\"no matter how rigorously an automated system is tested there will always be situations for which the system fails\",\"the terms automation bias or automation induced complacency describe how human users routinely rely on the output generated by a decision support system and stop using their own judgement or stop questioning whether the output might be wrong\",\"automated system support\",\"it is critically important that there is extensive human oversight in such settings\",\"systems should undergo pre deployment testing risk identification and mitigation and ongoing monitoring that demonstrate they are safe and effective based on their intended use mitigation of unsafe outcomes including those beyond the intended use and adherence to domain specific standards\",\"clear information to deployers on responsible use of the system\",\"they are automation bias\",\"the documentation should describe in plain language how the system works and how any automated component is used to determine an action or decision\",\"humans typically interact with a system in the design and training stages and may also be involved in operating the system and interpreting outputs\",\"the american public deserves the assurance that when rights opportunities or access are meaningfully at stake and there is a reasonable expectation of an alternative to an automated system they can conveniently opt out of an automated system and will not be disadvantaged for that choice\",\"in america and around the world systems supposed to help with patient care have proven unsafe ineffective or biased\",\"in order to ensure that those systems are used in a responsible and proportionate manner it is also important to establish that in each of those three exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations certain elements should be taken into account in particular as regards the nature of the situation giving rise to the request and the consequences of the use for the rights and freedoms of all persons concerned and the safeguards and conditions provided for with the use\",\"a list of examples of automated systems for which these principles should be considered is provided in the appendix\",\"the entity responsible for using the automated system should ensure that documentation describing the overall system including any human components is public and easy to find\",\"too often these tools are used to limit our opportunities and prevent our access to critical resources or services\",\"consider the social context of where when and how the system is being deployed\",\"these mechanisms should be tested to ensure that users who have trouble with the automated system are able to use human consideration and fallback with the understanding that it may be these users who are most likely to need the human assistance\",\"automated systems include but are not limited to systems derived from machine learning statistics or other data processing or artificial intelligence techniques and exclude passive computing infrastructure\",\"absent appropriate safeguards these technologies can lead to unfair inaccurate or dangerous outcomes\",\"for example organizations developing an ai system often will not have information about how the system may be used\",\"in order to ensure that an automated system is safe and effective it should include safeguards to protect the public from harm in a proactive and ongoing manner avoid use of data inappropriate for or irrelevant to the task at hand including reuse that could cause compounded harm and demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the system\",\"they should be designed to proactively protect you from harms stemming from unintended yet foreseeable uses or impacts of automated systems\",\"as a key component of the directive on automated decision making there are varying degrees of compliance based on the impact of each system\",\"processes for tracking responding to and recovering from incidents and errors are followed and documented\",\"the key considerations are human reviewers must be involved in checking the systems recommendation and should not just apply the automated recommendation to an individual in a routine fashion\",\"this includes ensuring that the new decision is entered into the automated system throughout its components any previous repercussions from the old decision are also overturned and safeguards are put in place to help ensure that future decisions do not result in the same errors\",\"developed through extensive consultation with the american public these principles are a blueprint for building and deploying automated systems that are aligned with democratic values and protect civil rights civil liberties and privacy\",\"all can benefit from assurances that automated systems will be designed tested and consistently confirmed to work as intended and that they will be proactively protected from foreseeable unintended harmful outcomes\",\"evidence that your service meets government accessibility requirements\",\"implement additional human oversight and safeguards for automated systems related to sensitive domainsautomated systems used within sensitive domains including criminal justice employment education and health should meet the expectations laid out throughout this framework especially avoiding capricious inappropriate and discriminatory impacts of these technologies\",\"where automated systems have been introduced to provide the public access to government benefits existing human paper and phone based processes are generally still in place providing an important alternative to ensure access\",\"the machinery directive the general product safety directive and initiatives that address liability issues related to new technologies including ai systems\",\"instructions should be provided in an accessible form and should be easily findable by those impacted by the automated system\",\"this framework instead shares a broad forward leaning vision of recommended principles for automated system development and use to inform private and public involvement with these systems where they have the potential to meaningfully impact rights opportunities or access\",\"article  would require that a system have capabilities to enable automatic logging of events and article  would require that the systems operations are sufficiently transparent for a user to interpret\",\"monitoring through measurement and assessment of high impact ai systems and their output is critical in supporting effective human oversight\",\"for instance the researchers deploying systems may not be those who made that system to begin with which makes validating the quality of the system and accurately predicting the decision making rationale of the person who made the system much harder\",\"this framework applies to  automated systems that  have the potential to meaningfully impact the american publics rights opportunities or access to critical resources or services\",\"automated systems where they are used in sensitive domains may play a role in directly providing information or otherwise providing positive outcomes to impacted people\",\"related tasks include piloting the system checking compatibility with legacy systems ensuring regulatory compliance managing organizational change and evaluating user experience\",\"you should have access to timely human consideration and remedy by a fallback and escalation process if an automated system fails it produces an error or you would like to appeal or contest its impacts on you\",\"any automated system collecting using sharing or storing personal data should meet these expectations\",\"you should consider the system requirements necessary to support a meaningful human review from the design phase\",\"users should receive notice of the use of automated systems in advance of using or while being impacted by the technology\",\"notices and explanations should be assessed such as by research on users experiences including user testing to ensure that the people using or impacted by the automated system are able to easily find notices and explanations read them quickly and understand and act on them\",\"automated systems should provide explanations that are technically valid meaningful and useful to you and to any operators or others who need to understand the system and calibrated to the level of risk based on the context\",\"underdeveloped software testing standards and inability to document ai based prac tices to the standard expected of traditionally engineered software for all but thesimplest of cases\",\"framework users are expected to benefit from\",\"systems should undergo extensive testing before deployment\",\"these monitoring procedures should be in place for the lifespan of the deployed automated system\",\"before deployment and in a proactive and ongoing manner potential risks of the automated system should be identified and mitigated\",\"automated systems should be tested using a broad set of measures to assess whether the system components both in pre deployment testing and in context deployment produce disparities\",\"rights that individuals have about solely automated decisions that affect them in legal or similarly significant ways are discussed in more detail in what is the role of human oversight as these rights raise particular challenges when using ai\",\"with regards to the directive on automated decision making the government of canada retains the right to authorise external parties to review and audit proprietary software components used for automated decision making systems in accordance with the information required by the algorithmic impact assessment\",\"however automated systems should not be allowed to directly intervene in high risk situations such as sentencing decisions or medical care without human consideration\",\"a defendant in the courtroom might not know if a judge denying their bail is informed by an automated system that labeled them high risk from correcting errors to contesting decisions people are often denied the knowledge they need to address the impact of automated systems on their lives\",\"while notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations the american public deserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights opportunities or access\",\"the appropriate application of the principles set forth in this white paper depends significantly on the context in which automated systems are being utilized\",\"part four covers compliance with individual rights including rights related to automated decision making\",\"those mechanisms shall be easy to access user friendly and allow for the submission of notices exclusively by electronic means\",\"as decision support where the system only supports a human decision maker in their deliberation\",\"there is extensive evidence showing that automated systems can produce inequitable outcomes and amplify existing inequity\",\"reportingentities responsible for the development or use of automated systems should provide regularly updated reports that include an overview of the system including how it is embedded in the organizations business processes or other activities system goals any human run procedures that form a part of the system and specific performance expectations a description of any data used to train machine learning models or for other purposes including how data sources were processed and interpreted a summary of what data might be missing incomplete or erroneous and data relevancy justifications the results of public consultation such as concerns raised and any decisions made due to these concerns risk identification and management assessments and any steps taken to mitigate potential harms the results of performance testing including but not limited to accuracy differential demographic impact resulting error rates overall and per demographic group and comparisons to previously deployed systems ongoing monitoring procedures and regular performance testing reports including monitoring frequency results and actions taken and the procedures for and results from independent evaluations\",\"consumers and others

government agencies have developed specific frameworks for ethical use of ai systems\",\"senior leaders data scientists business owners and those with oversight functions if you have them among others are expected to play an active role in ensuring that ai applications are designed built and used as intended\",\"one of the most relevant documents for understanding chinas approach to ai risk is guiding opinions on strengthening ethical governance of science and technology  which frames risk in the general context of science and technology and has a strong focus on regulatory policy for research and development\",\"centre for data ethics and innovation which identifies the measures needed to make sure the development of ai is safe ethical and innovative\",\"while the sum values can help you consider the ethical permissibility of your ai project they are not specifically catered to the particularities of designing developing and implementing an ai system\",\"govern  processes and procedures are in place for decommissioning and phasing out ai systems safely and in a manner that does not increase risks or decrease the organizations trustworthiness\",\"there is no accountability framework for the model\",\"care for the wellbeing of all\",\"the design development and use of ai systems must be safe and must respect the values of canadians\",\"this is without prejudice to the collective responsibility of boards and the respective responsibilities of each of the three lines of defence\",\"social responsibility can refer to the organizations responsibility for the impacts of its decisions and activities on society and the environment through transparent and ethical behavior\",\"in particular you should make sure your ai project is ethically permissible consider the impacts it may have on the wellbeing of affected stakeholders and communities\",\"you should establish a responsibility record which sets out who is responsible for different areas of the ai system\",\"the following guidance is designed to complement and supplement the data ethics framework\",\"the supervisory authorities take a principles based approach to governance\",\"the role of ai actors should be considered when seeking accountability for the outcomes of ai systems\",\"reflexivity on the part of the researcher is key\",\"there is a clear accountability framework for models in production\",\"by doing this you are implementing good data ethics by design\",\"as well as using the framework to guide our own audit and enforcement activity we also wanted to share our thinking behind it\",\"organizations need to establish and maintain the appropriate accountability mechanisms roles and responsibilities culture and incentive structures for risk management to be effective\",\"the obligations for ex ante testing risk management and human oversight will also facilitate the respect of other fundamental rights by minimising the risk of erroneous or biased ai assisted decisions in critical areas such as education and training employment important services law enforcement and the judiciary\",\"you should understand the framework of ethical values which support underwrite and motivate the responsible design and use of ai\",\"ethicist to provide ethical judgements and assessments on the ai models inputs\",\"why now is the time for a responsible ai framework in canadain the digital economy uses of ai are quickly becoming ubiquitous\",\"thus one person is entitled to enforcethe rights of another for their own benefit\",\"for example the combination of high quality data appropriate model choices and good governance can result in a well performing ai system and accurate outputs\",\"clear organizational oversight\",\"accountability consider who is responsible for each element of the models output and how the designers and implementers of ai systems will be held accountable\",\"building a good pbg framework for your ai project will provide your team with an overview of the relevant team members and roles involved in each governance action\",\"building a culture of responsible innovation\",\"research for legitimate purposes in relation to such ai systems should not be stifled by the prohibition if such research does not amount to use of the ai system in human machine relations that exposes natural persons to harm and

organization that is the subject of an audit to implement any measure specified in the auditan organization responsible for a high impact system to cease using it or making it available for use if there are reasonable grounds to believe the use of the system gives rise to a serious risk of imminent harmadministration aida creates a statutory right for the minister to designate a senior official of the department over which the minister presides to be called the artificial intelligence and data commissioner whose role is to assist the minister in the administration and enforcement of aida\",\"following a similar pattern the proposed legislation aida will require the persons responsible for an artificial intelligence system to conduct an assessment on whether it is a high impact system\",\"international developments regarding the regulation of ai are likely to have a material effect on subsequent changes to the aida  and any regulations enacted after it becomes law\",\"however it will give you as well as the ico a fuller and more meaningful view of your risk positions and the adequacy of your compliance and risk management approaches\",\"the differences between regulated activities and high impact systems are outlined below\",\"why is this research important for policy\",\"in terms of social impacts the directive will increase societal trust in ai technologies andaccess to an effective justice system\",\"approaches for measuring impacts on a population work best if they recognize that contexts matter that harms may affect varied groups or sub groups differently and that communities or other sub groups who may be harmed are not always direct users of a system\",\"like the eu draft ai act the canadian government intends to establish a new monitoring authority to assist with administration and enforcement of aida\",\"still it is concerned with high impact ai systems with respect to setting out requirements to identify assess and mitigate the risk of harm and biassed output that could result from the use of such ai systems\",\"the aida would also mobilize external expertise in the private sector academia and civil society to ensure that enforcement activities are conducted in the context of a rapidly developing environment\",\"for example more vulnerable groups such as children may face greater risk of harm from a high impact ai system and necessitate specific risk mitigation efforts\",\"such action is especially needed in high impact sectors including climate change environment and health the public sector finance mobility home affairs and agriculture\",\"amps are a flexible compliance tool that could be used directly by the regulator in response to any violation in order to encourage compliance with the obligations of the act\",\"the aida imposes regulatory requirements for both ai systems generally and those ai systems specifically referred to as high impact systems which we discuss in further detail below\",\"the action plan to advance property appraisal and valuation equity includes a commitment from the agencies that oversee mortgage lending to include a nondiscrimination standard in the proposed rules for automated valuation models\",\"there are four different levels of impact from lower to higher\",\"we will need to assess your response to inform our work as a regulator and central bank both in the public interest and in the exercise of our official authority\",\"demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the systemindependent evaluation\",\"omb also points to numerous examples of effective and proactive stakeholder engagement including the community based participatory research program developed by the national institutes of health and the participatory technology assessments developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration\",\"relevancy should be established based on research backed demonstration of the causal influence of the data to the specific use case or justified more generally based on a reasonable expectation of usefulness in the domain andor for the system design or ongoing development\",\"you consider the impact of individuals reasonable expectations\",\"after substantial revision of the impact assessment to address the comments and a resubmission of the impact assessment the regulatory scrutiny board issued a positive opinion on  march\",\"at this time it is difficult to evaluate the impact and scope of the aida  and we will have to wait for the regulation to define a high impact system\",\"after instituting the outcomes in govern most users of the ai rmf would start with the map function and continue to measure or manage\",\"under aida businesses putting in place such measures would have to monitor compliance with the measures as well as their effectiveness\",\"but the overall magnitude of their impacts may be most readily visible at the level of communities\",\"unintended negative consequences creators have not thoroughly considered the potential negative impacts their systems may have on the individuals and communities they affect\",\"unintended negative consequences creators have not thoroughly considered the potential negative impacts their systems may have on the individuals and communities they affect\",\"the regulations that would follow the royal assent of the aida would ensure that responsibilities for monitoring would be proportionate to the level of influence that an actor has on the risk associated with the system\",\"therefore the preferred policy option was developed and refined in light of feedback receivedfrom stakeholders throughout the impact assessment process to strike a balance between theneeds expressed and concerns raised by all relevant stakeholder groups\",\"that is why the governments proposed approach in this area has attracted a lot of attention\",\"under the aida businesses conducting regulated activities would be accountable for ensuring that employees implement measures to address risks associated with high impact ai systems\",\"first the sector specific interventions address a small subset of issues eg\",\"as noted above the aida limits application to interprovincial and international commerce ostensibly leaving intra provincial ai matters to the regulation of the provinces if and when they so choose\",\"they would be held accountable for the creation and enforcement of appropriate internal governance processes and policies to achieve compliance with the aida\",\"as part of the directive government agencies must complete an algorithmic impact assessment of a system before production\",\"providing for a robust monitoring and evaluation mechanism is crucial to ensure that the proposal will be effective in achieving its specific objectives\",\"the relevant stages of the workflow in which intervention and targeted consideration are necessary to meet governance goals\",\"manage  post deployment ai system monitoring plans are implemented including mechanisms for capturing and evaluating input from users and other relevant ai actors appeal and override decommissioning incident response recovery and change management\",\"meanwhile the directive on automated decision making introduces an algorithmic impact assessment aia tool which establishes a framework with four different impact assessment levels from lowest to highest\",\"results of ex post evaluations stakeholder consultations and impact assessmentsex post evaluationsfitness checks of existing legislationthis proposal builds on the evaluation of the e commerce directive conducted as a back to back evaluation with the impact assessment accompanying the proposal\",\"while the general approach in aida is apparent the full impact of the legislation will only be appreciated with the release of associated regulations which will set out most of the detailed application\",\"ongoing monitoring and mitigation\",\"first it addresses a range of harms to individuals\",\"evaluated through an algorithmic impact assessment tool aia a component of the directive system deployers are required to assess their system using the aia to determine the impact level of automated decision making systems adms and follow the appropriate compliance requirements as outlined in annex c of the directive\",\"the design and development requirements would need to be met before a high impact system is made available for use\",\"for example public sector organisations are required to undertake equality impact assessments while other organisations voluntarily undertake algorithm impact assessments\",\"the policy document also states that there is a need to design a suitable monitoring and evaluation framework to monitor progress as well as criteria for future updates to the framework to ensure a robust approach to identifying and addressing evolving risks\",\"where an ai system meets the definition of a high impact system the person responsible mustestablish measures to identify assess and mitigate the risks of harm or biased output that could result from the use of the systemestablish measures to monitor compliance with the mitigation measures and the effectiveness of those mitigation measureswhere the system is made available for use or an organization is managing the operation of the system publish on a public website a plain language description of the system that includes prescribed content andnotify the minister of industry or other designated minister if use of the system results or is likely to result in material harm\",\"when outcomes go beyond target levels you should have processes to swiftly assess compliance and take action if necessary\",\"sections in this part deal with the ai specific implications of accountability including data protection impact assessments dpias and controller  processor responsibilities\",\"it identifies activities involved in the lifecycle of a high impact ai system and imposes obligations for businesses carrying out those activities in order to ensure accountability at each point where risk may be introduced\",\"budgetary implicationsthe budgetary impact of the proposal will be covered by the allocations foreseen in the mff   under the financial envelopes of the digital europe programme and single market programme as detailed in the legislative financial statement accompanying this proposal for a regulationthese implications require also reprogramming of heading  of the financial perspective\",\"high impact systems are assessed on various factors with impact levels varying based on the systems effect on the rights health and wellbeing of individuals or communities economic interests and sustainability of an ecosystem reversibility and duration\",\"results of ex post evaluations stakeholderconsultations and impact assessments stakeholder consultationsan

accounttheir effectiveness efficiency coherence and proportionality\",\"impact assessmentthe regulatory scrutiny board issued a positive opinion with reservations on the impact assessment including suggestions for improvement\",\"in addition the aida provides authority for the minister to designate an artificial intelligence and data commissioner whose role would be to assist in the administration and enforcement of the aida\",\"in the first stage the objectives are achieved witha minimally invasive approach the second stage involves re assessing the need for morestringent or extensive measures\",\"with regard to added value in the enforcement of measures the initiative creates important efficiency gains in the cooperation across member states and mutualising some resources for technical assistance at eu level for inspecting and auditing content moderation systems recommender systems and online advertising on very large online platforms\",\"furthermore it states that actors such as impact assessors and evaluators will provide technical human factor socio cultural and legal expertise to carry out impact assessments of ai systems including evaluating the requirements for ai system accountability combating bias examining the impacts of ai systems product safety liability and security among others\",\"some of these requirements resemble those of the draft ai act including the requirement to establish measures to identify assess and mitigate the risks of harm and to establish measures to monitor compliance with the mitigation measures\",\"ai can benefit the public sector in a number of ways\",\"in addition the aida would create a new statutory role for an ai and data commissioner who would support the minister in carrying out these responsibilities\",\"ai system impact assessment approaches can help ai actors understand potential impacts or harms within specific contexts\",\"the govern and map functions describe the importance of interdisciplinarity and demographically diverse teams and utilizing feedback from potentially impacted individuals and communities\",\"most of this guidance will apply regardless of which part of the dpa applies to your processing\",\"the aida would ensure accountability for risks associated with high impact ai systems used in the course of international and interprovincial trade and commerce\",\"first the commissioner could request by order the provision of records ie about system assessment risk management monitoring measures and data anonymization with the ability to request additional records if there were to be reasonable grounds to believe that the use of a high impact system could result in harm or biassed outputs\",\"aida creates three new criminal offences to directly prohibit and address specific behaviours of concern\",\"transparencytransparency means providing the public with appropriate information about how high impact ai systems are being used\",\"aida provides for two types of penalties for regulatory non compliance  administrative monetary penalties amps and prosecution of regulatory offences  as well as a separate mechanism for true criminal offences\",\"it targeted all interested stakeholders from the public and private sectors including governments local authorities commercial and non commercial organisations social partners experts academics and citizens\",\"it is intended to build understanding among stakeholders and canadians on the proposed legislation as well to support parliamentary consideration of the bill\",\"ensuring some of the additional protections proposed in this framework would require new laws to be enacted or new policies and practices to be adopted\",\"this includes the proactive documentation of policies processes and measures implemented\",\"impact assessmentin line with its better regulation policy the commission conducted an impact assessmentfor this proposal examined by the commissions regulatory scrutiny board\",\"what is the purpose of the aida\",\"however aida defers to later regulations for further specifications on what those measures should be\",\"these actors can assist in providing context and understanding potential and actual impacts\",\"in addition to conducting a dpia you may also be required to undertake other kinds of impact assessments or do so voluntarily\",\"this would enable the government to avoid imposing undue impacts on the ai ecosystem\",\"increases in funding\",\"the relevant stages of the workflow in which intervention and targeted consideration are necessary to meet governance goals\",\"access to critical resources and services including but not limited tohealth and health insurance technologies such as medical ai systems and devices ai assisted diagnostic tools algorithms or predictive models used to support clinical decision making medical or insurance health risk assessments drug addiction risk assessments and associated access algorithms wearable technologies wellness apps insurance care allocation algorithms and health insurance cost and underwriting algorithmsfinancial system algorithms such as loan allocation algorithms financial system access determination algorithms credit scoring systems insurance algorithms including risk assessments automated interest rate determinations and financial algorithms that apply penalties eg that can garnish wages or withhold tax returnssystems that impact the safety of communities such as automated traffic control systems electrical grid controls smart city technologies and industrial emissions and environmental impact control algorithms andsystems related to access to benefits or services or assignment of penalties such as systems that support decision makers who adjudicate benefits such as collating or analyzing information or matching records systems which similarly assist in the adjudication of administrative or criminal penalties fraud detection algorithms services or benefits access control algorithms biometric systems used as access control and systems which make benefits or services related decisions on a fully or partially autonomous basis such as a determination to revoke benefits\",\"the regulated activities laid out in the aida would then be associated with distinct obligations that are proportionate to the risk\",\"in cases where there is a risk of imminent harm the minister may take actions such asorder cessation of use of a system ordisclose publicly information regarding contraventions of the act or for the purpose of preventing harm\",\"while the act allows for the creation of an amps regime it would require regulations and consultations to come into force\",\"logging and monitoring the output of the system as appropriate in the contextensuring adequate monitoring and human oversightintervening as needed based on operational parametersoversight and enforcementin the initial years after it comes into force the focus of aida would be on education establishing guidelines and helping businesses to come into compliance through voluntary means\",\"the impact assessment report was further revised along these lines notably in clarifying the interlinks between the digital services act and the broader regulatory framework providing more detailed descriptions of the policy options and a more detailed analysis of the underlying evidence addressed in the revised impact assessment report\",\"measures to enhance transparency and accountability should also consider the impact of these efforts on the implementing entity including the level of necessary resources and the need to safeguard proprietary information\",\"in addition to administrative penalties the aida would also introduce offences that include significant fines and potential imprisonment for non compliance\",\"the aida proposes the following approachbuilding on existing canadian consumer protection and human rights law aida would ensure that high impact ai systems meet the same expectations with respect to safety and human rights to which canadians are accustomed\",\"there is also a provision on crisis protocols to address extraordinary circumstances affecting public security or public health article\",\"it is intended to encapsulate a broad range of adverse impacts that may result across the sectors of the economy\",\"this helps reduce potential harm to all individuals involved in the research and helps maintain public acceptability around the production of research and statistics and enables researchers to efficiently access and harness data that supports the production of statistics for the public good\",\"however the aida requires an election a person may be subject to an administrative penalty for a violation or more serious sanctions of an offence\",\"the office of management and budget omb has called for an expansion of opportunities for meaningful stakeholder engagement in the design of programs and services\",\"the legislative financial statement accompanying this proposal for a regulation covers the budgetary impacts for the regulation itself\",\"the intended outcomes for individuals or wider society as well as for you\",\"the directive which came into force in april  is part of the governments efforts to utilise ai to make or assist in making administrative decisions to improve service delivery\",\"the stated purposes of the aida are toregulate international and interprovincial trade and commerce in ai systems by establishing common requirements applicable across canada for the design development and use of those systems andprohibit certain conduct in relation to ai systems that may result in serious harm to individuals or harm to their interests\",\"it will be difficult to know the full impact of aida without the release of the regulations\",\"the open public consultation informing the impact assessment of this proposal confirmedthe problems explained above\",\"as a result administration and enforcement decisions have important implications for policy and the two functions would need to be work in close collaboration in the early years of the framework under the direction of the minister\",\"if ai systems are used for determining whether such benefits and services should be denied reduced revoked or reclaimed by authorities they may have a significant impact on persons livelihood and may infringe their fundamental rights such as the right to social protection nondiscrimination human dignity or an effective remedy\",\"by reducing the amount of fertilizers and pesticides neededdecreasing the water consumption at equal output etc\",\"to which entities will the aida apply\",\"there are four different levels of impact from lower to higher\",\"independent evaluation and reporting that confirms that the system is safe and effective including reporting of steps taken to mitigate potential harms should be performed and the results made public whenever possible\",\"finally different from the draft ai act aida would not require a certification system for high impact systems through a conformity assessment\",\"the potential impacts of these systems include harm to psychological and physical health\",\"among other things it will provide guidance on matters related to the implementation of the ai act including on enforcement matters\",\"the minister mayrequire any person responsible for a high impact system to cease using it or making it available for use where the minister has reasonable grounds to believe that the use of the system gives rise to a serious risk of imminent harmrequire the audited person implement any measure specified in the order to address anything referred to in an audit report orrequire a person to publish on a publicly available website certain information including audit details so long as it does not require disclosure confidential business information\",\"administrative penaltiesthose violating the aida can be liable for administrative monetary penalties\",\"they can be disproportionately affected by restrictions and removal measures following from unconscious or conscious biases potentially embedded in the notification systems by users and third parties as well as replicated in automated content moderation tools used by platforms\",\"any potential for bias no matter how big or small and the impacts that may arise from this should be clearly communicated with all stakeholders and documented throughout the project\",\"what was the key policy challenge that the research seeks to address\",\"these regulatory tools support in turning high level policy objectives into tangible outcomes so are worthy of particular attention\",\"for public authorities the proposed option would cut the costs brought by the inefficiencies and duplications in the existing set up for the cooperation of authorities\",\"the proposal also prohibits ai based social scoring for general purposes done by public authorities\",\"this will be undertaken on two levels both at the overall system level and at the individual regulator level\",\"natural persons applying for or receiving public assistance benefits and services from public authorities are typically dependent on those benefits and services and in a vulnerable position in relation to the responsible authorities\",\"the other costs will be supported from the dep\",\"outcomes of these protective measures should include the possibility of not deploying the system or removing a system from use\",\"businesses who design or develop a high impact ai system would be expected to take measures to identify and address risks with regards to harm and bias document appropriate use and limitations and adjust the measures as needed\",\"the opinions of the regulatory scrutiny board the recommendations and an explanation of how they have been taken into account are presented in annex  of the impact assessment\",\"with regards to building a risk framework canadas aida only proposes a division that distinguishes high impact systems from any regulated activity without specifying risk thresholds\",\"canadas focus on impact is similar to the uks which emphasises the actual impact of ai technologies rather than hypothetical risks as well as the usas blueprint for an ai bill of rights which focuses on the impacts ai systems can have on rights and democratic values\",\"regulations defining which systems would be considered high impact as well as specific requirements would be developed in consultation with a broad range of stakeholders to ensure that they are effective at protecting the interests of the canadian public while avoiding imposing an undue burden on the canadian ai ecosystem\",\"other elementsimplementation plans and monitoring evaluation and reporting arrangementsthe commission will establish a comprehensive framework for continuously monitoring the output results and impact of this legislative instrument upon the date of its application\",\"as regards environmental impacts the directive is also expected to contribute to achievingthe related sustainable development goals sdgs and targets\",\"businesses who make a high impact ai system available for use would be expected to consider potential uses when deployed and take measures to ensure users are aware of any restrictions on how the system is meant to be used and understand its limitations\",\"it can be performed using a variety of approaches taking into account whether and how demographic information of impacted people is available for example via testing with a sample of users or via qualitative user experience research\",\"ised would continue to assess the effectiveness of the regulations as it administers and enforces the act\",\"the federal governments directive also uses impact level definitions little or no impact to very high impact and based on the degree of impact the deputy head or treasury board will be responsible for approval of the system\",\"the targeted review will assess whether additional measureswould be needed such as introducing a strict liability regime andor mandatory insurance\",\"the following are examples of systems that are of interest to the government in terms of their potential impactsscreening systems impacting access to services or employmentthese ai systems are intended to make decisions recommendations or predictions for purposes relating to access to services such as credit or employment\",\"the higher the impact the more frequently you should monitor and report on it\",\"high impact ai systems considerations and systems of interestunder aida the criteria for high impact systems would be defined in regulation in order to allow for precision in the identification of systems that need to be regulated through this framework for inter operability with international frameworks such as the eu ai act and for updates to occur as the technology advances\",\"such an outcome would have significant impacts on opportunities for canadians and the canadian economy\",\"main economic social and environmental impactsthe directive will contribute to the rollout of ai\",\"the general public is most likely to directly experience positive and negative impacts of ai technologies\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"AIDA and high impact AI

with someone who has deep knowledge of your data such as a data scientist\",\"evaluations of ai rmf effectiveness  including ways to measure bottom line improvements in the trustworthiness of ai systems  will be part of future nist activities in conjunction with the ai community\",\"addressing ai trustworthiness characteristics individually will not ensure ai system trustworthiness tradeoffs are usually involved rarely do all characteristics apply in every setting and some will be more or less important in any given situation\",\"this provides a benchmark that your team can later compare more complex models against and will help your team identify problems in your data\",\"explicit timeframes for any evaluations follow up actions re assessments and continuous monitoring\",\"for example in credit risk accuracy or consistency errors within the dataset will likely impact the ability of the ai model to accurately quantify the probability of default and risk of loss which could in turn lead to inaccurate capital modelling\",\"its then useful to assess the data against criteria for a combination of accuracy completeness uniqueness relevancy sufficiency timeliness representativeness validity or consistency\",\"however such a measure could be misleading\",\"nist intends to work collaboratively with others to develop metrics methodologies and goals for evaluating the ai rmfs effectiveness and to broadly share results and supporting information\",\"this measure looks to embed accountability in all aspects of a firms use of ai and ml and helps ensure the technology and its underlying data is appropriately understood tested deployed and monitored\",\"processes for independent review can improve the effectiveness of testing and can mitigate internal biases and potential conflicts of interest\",\"it is important to measure and prioritise the right ones\",\"some of these endeavours have resulted in the development of standards for instance a standard for autonomous driving test scenarios initiated by china was formally accepted by the international organisation for standardisation iso\",\"trustworthiness characteristics are inextricably tied to social and organizational behavior the datasets used by ai systems selection of ai models and algorithms and the decisions made by those who build them and the interactions with the humans who provide insight from and oversight of such systems\",\"on the basis of the results of that evaluation the commission shall decide whether the national measure is justified or not within  months from the notification referred to in article  and notify such decision to the member state concerned\",\"measure  effectiveness of the employed tevv metrics and processes in the measure function are evaluated and documented\",\"for this reason you should use alternative measures of statistical accuracy to assess how good a system is\",\"supports the work of our investigation and assurance teams when assessing the compliance of organisations using ai\",\"the latter aims to create a standard for an ai conformity assessment scheme which could also be adopted in the eu draft ai act\",\"statistical accuracy as a general measure is about how closely an ai systems predictions match the correct labels as defined in the test data\",\"the osr code of practice sets the standards that producers of official statistics should commit to\",\"accuracy and robustness contribute to the validity and trustworthiness of ai systems and can be in tension with one another in ai systems\",\"measure  internal experts who did not serve as front line developers for the system andor independent assessors are involved in regular assessments and updates\",\"for example if an ai system is used to classify emails as spam or not spam a simple measure of statistical accuracy is the number of emails that were correctly classified as spam or not spam as a proportion of all the emails that were analysed\",\"consistency with the ai act should also be ensured\",\"they shall take into account the generally acknowledged state of the art including as reflected in relevant harmonised standards or common specifications\",\"it aims to foster the development of innovative approaches including audits to address various characteristics of trustworthy ai systems including accuracy explainability privacy robustness safety and mitigation of harmful biases\",\"there is a clear testing and monitoring framework in place\",\"following testing system performance should be compared with the in place potentially human driven status quo procedures with existing human performance considered as a performance baseline for the algorithm to meet pre deployment and as a lifecycle minimum performance standard\",\"this helps ensure that any decisions taken on the basis of the potentially incorrect inference are informed by any evidence that it may be wrong\",\"for ai systems to be trustworthy they often need to be responsive to a multiplicity of criteria that are of value to interested parties\",\"it may do so with high statistical accuracy even though you did not intend for it to do so\",\"entities should conduct regular independent audits and take prompt corrective measures to maintain accurate timely and complete

lifecycle\",\"identification and classification while the supervisory authorities do not currently provide an explicit definition of a model the pra proposed definition is being consulted on in cp the pra expects that banks should give consideration to what factors would constitute a model and must establish their own definition of a model and furthermore banks should maintain a model inventory with clear information regarding but not limited to owners users uses and direct or material dependencies see pra ss model risk management principles for stress testing\",\"however this should be done with care and only after careful consideration as deletion of some data may make the model worse or less transparent for the user\",\"plan and prototype your ai model build and service\",\"alpha build and evaluate your machine learning model\",\"even models which are not overfitted to the training data can still be vulnerable to privacy attacks\",\"a query is sent to the ml model containing the predictor variables for a new instance eg a new customers age income occupation\",\"evaluating your model undertake continuous evaluation to make sure the model still meets business objectives and the model is performing at the level required\",\"your team will need to test your models throughout the process to mitigate against issues such as overfitting or underfitting that could undermine your models effectiveness once deployed\",\"whilst developers cannot stop others from using their models to remain accountable anyone making and training models should try to be explicit in communicating the intended use of a model so that models are not created that are then used by others in the wrong way\",\"the extent to which poor model performance leads to poor outcomes can depend on the degree of autonomy of a model\",\"this will make sure the model performance is in line with the modelling phase and to help you identify when to retrain the model\",\"for example some ai providers give third parties an entire pre trained model and allow them to run it locally\",\"when you complete building your ai prototyping phase you should have a final model or set of predictive models and a summary of their performance and characteristics\",\"integration can happen in a number of ways from a local deployment to the creation of a custom application for staff or customers\",\"the programmer will reward the machine when it does what the programmer wants and penalise it when it does not though the programmer will not give the models help in making these decisions\",\"how and when you will evaluate the model\",\"what level of performance you need before deploying the model\",\"in addition to ongoing cost youll need to think about the network and memory resources your team will need to train your model\",\"this will depend on a number of factors including the intended use of the model the maintainability of the model and its outputs and whether using the more transparent alternative risks sacrificing the quality or accuracy of another more opaque model\",\"when choosing your final model you will need to consider what level of performance your problem needs\",\"at least one domain knowledge expert who knows the environment where you will be deploying the ai model results\",\"in some cases ml model providers and clients will be joint controllers and therefore need to perform a joint risk assessment\",\"this is because even if these variables are excluded from the model they could still be correlated from other data points and identify protected characteristics\",\"one possible cause of ml models being vulnerable to privacy attacks is known as overfitting\",\"step  firm a uses this model to develop a high impact system by training it on data under their control and then place it on the market for use  firm a would need to comply with the requirements for development and making available for use which would be laid out in regulation eg testing ensuring that all measures needed for safe and fair operation are in place providing documentation to firms purchasing the system\",\"as the model provider you will be less easily able to monitor the model during deployment and thereby assess and mitigate the risk of privacy attacks on it\",\"if you are operating as a controller your contract with the processor must stipulate that the processor assist you in responding to rights requests\",\"you also need to take care to identify and understand controller  processor relationships\",\"these two approaches correspond to different operational models\",\"as

into the model and the outputs that it produces\",\"using your model in your service has three stages\",\"safe operation of ai systems is improved through responsible design development and deployment practices\",\"as the aippf final report noted backup and remediation actions being considered before the model is put into production can enable firms to respond appropriately and in a timely manner if an ai model performance or output deteriorates beyond the accepted risk threshold which can help manage risks\",\"similar to the earlier frt example membership inference attacks can exploit

validation of an ml system both before deployment and where appropriate after an update\",\"if you are going to provide a whole model to others via an application programming interface api you will not be subject to white box attacks in this way because the apis users will not have direct access to the model itself\",\"how the data and models are stored such as the formats they are serialised and stored in and local caching\",\"the gravity of the consequences of models vulnerability to membership inference will depend on how sensitive or revealing membership might be\",\"datasets used to train ai systems may become detached from their original and intended context or may become stale or outdated relative to deployment context\",\"your team should build a simple baseline version model before they build any more complex models\",\"you can consider whether there is a clear and accountable owner of the model\",\"build a prototype of the model and service\",\"decisions that go into the design development deployment evaluation and use of ai systems reflect systemic and human cognitive biases\",\"ai deployment actors are responsible for contextual decisions relating to how the ai

of the ai model to make sure any code developed is production ready\",\"you cannot integrate the model\",\"as we review our cloud computing guidance we will consult on the scenarios which could result in an organisation becoming a controller which may include when organisations make decisions about the source and nature of the data used to train an ai model\",\"ai development actors provide the initial infrastructure of ai systems and are responsible for model building and interpretation tasks which involve the creation selection calibration training andor testing of models or algorithms\",\"questions for you to consider with data scientists are do you have enough data for the model to learn from\",\"using a pre existing model with the same intended use as a basis for your project may save time and money\",\"feature selection  the features that may be used in each model\",\"once you select a final model your team will need to assess its performance and refine it to make sure it performs as well as you need it to\",\"include reasonable features processes and analytical structures in your model architecture design fairness\",\"responsible decision making by deployers and end users\",\"you can action this by focusing on the infrastructure requirements for your ai pipelines as the same time your team is developing the model\",\"your team should split your data into a training set to train algorithms during the modelling phase validation set for assessing the performance of your models test set for a final check on the performance of your best model\",\"for example an ml model could be installed on the users own device and make inferences locally rather than being hosted on a cloud server\",\"in white box attacks the attacker has complete access to the model itself and can inspect its underlying code and properties although not the training data\",\"how it performs compared to simpler models\",\"for any given ai system an ai designer or developer may have a different perception of the characteristics than the deployer\",\"building verification and validation task and output eg\",\"include reasonable features processes and analytical structures

maintain the model\",\"moving from alpha to beta involves integrating the model into the services decision making process and using live data for the model to make predictions on\",\"moreover the proposed principles cover all elements of the model lifecycle and would be applicable to all types of models that are used to inform key business decisions whether developed in house or externally including vendor models and models used for financial reporting purposes\",\"for example the product offers a customer sees on a website might be driven by the output of the predictive model stored in their profile\",\"the complexity of the organisation deploying it\",\"using pre trained models may be particularly problematic if the model lacks transparency as it may be harder to identify the processes used to train the model and existing biases\",\"designers and implementers of ai systems should be able toexplain to affected stakeholders how and why a model performed the way it did in a specific context\",\"there is an important distinction between black box and white box attacks on models\",\"key model parameters eg how complex a decision tree can be or how many models will be included in an ensemble\",\"you should continue to collect user needs so your team can use the models outputs in the real world\",\"keep this data separate from your models until this final test\",\"for example models may become correlated in subtle ways and add to risks of herding or procyclical behaviour at times of market stress\",\"step  a researcher at a university publishes a new model that can be used to develop ai systems  no regulatory requirements or liability under aida as it is not a commercial activity and the model alone is not a complete ai system\",\"in addition it is possible to train an ml model using a programming language and framework suitable for exploratory development but then convert the model into another more secure format for deployment\",\"model validation and independent review the validation and independent review of an ai model is important in order to ensure an objective view is given on the model inclusive of the way in which it is developed and that it is suitable for the intended purpose\",\"while it is not a legal requirement having a well organised model management system and deployment pipeline will make it easier and cheaper to accommodate these requests and re training and redeploying your ai models accordingly will be less costly\",\"this will give you an indication of how your model will perform in the real world\",\"evaluate the model\",\"if you are considering using a pre trained model it is important to understand what the model was built to be used for and ensure before it is implemented that it is suitable for your own project\",\"if you are using a pre existing model have you ensured that you are using it in the way it was intended\",\"you should regularly assess drift and retrain the model on new data where necessary\",\"justifiable prioritise the transparency of how you design and implement your model and the justification and interpretability of its decisions and behaviours\",\"after creating a beta version you team can use automated testing to create some high level tests before moving to more thorough testing\",\"it may be useful to discuss your project with independent colleagues as part of challenge sessions both to maximise collective understanding and to provide an additional opportunity to check the model is doing what is expected\",\"model uses and impacts\",\"make sure your model is fair explainable and you have a process for monitoring unexpected or biased outputs\",\"as part of your accountability responsibilities you should decide and document appropriate thresholds for determining whether your model needs to be retrained based on the nature scope context and purposes of the processing and the risks it poses\",\"in a model inversion attack if attackers already have access to some personal data belonging to specific individuals included in the training data they can infer further personal information about those same individuals by observing the inputs and outputs of the ml model\",\"the nature of the hyperparametersfootnote functional form of the models and their outputs can also adapt continuously\",\"if you are

box attacks\",\"utilising models beyond their intended use without care and caution may impact upon the accuracy and validity of your results\",\"by definition they are external to the design development or deployment team of the organization that acquires its technologies or services\",\"tevv tasks for deployment include system validation and integration in production with testing and recalibration for systems and process integration user experience and compliance with existing legal regulatory and ethical specifications\",\"if you train models and provide them to others you should assess whether those models may contain personal data or are at risk of revealing it if attacked and take appropriate steps to mitigate these risks\",\"if you are using machine learning with personal data you should proactively  assess the chances that your model might be inferring protected characteristics or special category data or both in order to make predictions and actively monitor this

models performance\",\"when the user opens the news app the days news is sent to the phone and the local model would select the most relevant stories to show to the user based on the user personal habits or profile information which are tracked and stored on the device itself and are not shared with the content provider or app store\",\"these services enable clients to build and run their own models with data they have chosen but using the tools and infrastructure the organisation provides in the cloud\",\"this enables each client to make overarching decisions about their model including whether to further process personal data from their own context to improve their own model\",\"for example if your model is scoring cvs as part of a recruitment exercise and the kinds of skills candidates need in a particular job are likely to change every two years you should anticipate assessing the need to re train your fresh data at least that often\",\"evaluate the model\",\"justifiable prioritise the transparency of how you design and implement your model and the justification and interpretability of its decisions and behaviours\",\"while sharing the gradient derived from a locally

the deployment phase\",\"how was the model evaluatedcompared against other models\",\"your simple model will provide baseline metrics and information on the models behaviour that you can use to test more complex models\",\"for example you need to do this where the ai system was developed for a general purpose task and you then deploy it in different contexts for different purposes\",\"testing conditions should mirror as closely as possible the conditions in which the system will be deployed and new testing may be required for each deployment to account for material differences in conditions from one deployment to another\",\"limes use a simpler surrogate model to summarise the relationships between input and output pairs that are similar to those in the system you are trying to interpret\",\"iterate and deploy improved models\",\"if it is not feasible to deploy the model locally other privacy enhancing techniques exist to minimise the data that is revealed in a query sent to a ml model\",\"typically once deployed the outputs of an ai system are stored in a profile of an individual and used to take some action about them\",\"if the request is for access to the data you could fulfil this without altering the model\",\"however new types of privacy attacks on ml models suggest that this is sometimes possible\",\"case example a system developed by multiple actorsconsider the case of an ai system with multiple development steps involving both research and commercial activities\",\"avoiding overfitting will help both in mitigating the risk of privacy attacks and also in ensuring that the model is able to make good inferences on new examples it hasnt seen before\",\"simply removing any protected characteristics from the inputs the model uses to make a prediction is unlikely to be enough as there are often variables which are proxies for the protected characteristics\",\"the way the model is deployed eg via a user interface which doesnt meet

decision making process\",\"for example an online decision to award a business grant\",\"actions do not constitute a checklist nor are they necessarily an ordered set of steps\",\"you should therefore assess whether in your context lime and similar approaches will help the human decision maker to meaningfully interpret the ai system and its output\",\"this allows persons to make informed choices or

is because it does not involve directly making any decisions about individuals\",\"this is a highly iterative process requiring substantial amounts of data and will see your team probably build a number of ai models before deciding on the most effective and appropriate algorithm for your problem\",\"against each identified risk to individuals interests you should consider options to reduce the level of assessed risk further\",\"however the resulting decisions could still constitute automated decision making within the meaning of data protection law\",\"for the governments use of ai canada was the first national government to launch a policy of this kind the directive on automate decision making which was released in spring\",\"the degree and quality of human review and intervention before a final decision is made about an individual are key factors in determining whether an ai system is being used for automated decision making or merely as decision support\",\"since using an

projectsustainability\",\"whether you need to consult the ico\",\"the evaluation has not revealed particularly high or disproportionate costs and no substantial concerns have been raised regarding impacts on small and medium sized enterprises\",\"using virtual machines or containers emulations of a computer system that run inside but isolated from the rest of the it system may help here these can be pre configured specifically for ml tasks\",\"ai applications could be used in a way that excludes certain consumers\",\"as with all projects you need to make sure youre hypothesis led and can constantly iterate to best help your users and their needs\",\"if you place more importance on finding as many of the positive cases as possible maximising recall this may come at the cost of some false positives lowering precision\",\"options may include recalibration impact mitigation or removal of the system from design development production or use as well as a range of compensating detective deterrent directive and recovery controls\",\"you should use our existing guidance on controllers and processors to help you with this\",\"questionable design creators have not thoroughly considered technical issues related to algorithmic bias and safety risks\",\"the benefits risks and harms discussed in this chapter are neither exhaustive nor applicable to every ai use case\",\"this could be the case for example when the non professional user does not comply with the instructions of use or with other applicableduties of care when choosing the area of operation or when setting performanceconditions of the ai system\",\"they may not be appropriate or sufficiently mature to deploy in your particular context\",\"youll need to investigate alternative mature technology solutions thoroughly to check if this is the case\",\"use cloud first when setting up your infrastructure\",\"you should monitor developments in these methods and assess whether they can provide meaningful data minimisation before attempting to implement them\",\"whatever your approach you should ensure that your staff have appropriate skills and knowledge to address these security risks\",\"rather than always collecting a users actual keystrokes the system could be designed to create noisy ie false words at random\",\"have you shared your code for others to use and adapt\",\"the appropriate security measures you should adopt depend on the level and type of risks that arise from specific processing activities\",\"if in operating the system firm b showed reckless disregard for the safety of other persons they could be prosecuted for a criminal offence under the criminal code\",\"you should assess the means that may be reasonably likely to be used in light of the vulnerabilities described above\",\"you may still be able to make some technical decisions as a processor\",\"however buying your ai technology may not always be suitable as the specifics of your data and needs could mean the supplier would have to build from scratch or significantly customise an existing ai model\",\"unless there is a good reason not to do so you should seek and document the views of individuals or their representatives on the intended processing operation during a dpia\",\"if a proxy is identified designers developers and deployers should remove the proxy if needed it may be possible to identify alternative attributes that can be used instead\",\"since new risks and compliance considerations may arise during the course of the deployment you should regularly review any outsourced services and be able to modify them or switch to another provider if their use is no longer compliant in your circumstances\",\"as this is a rapidly developing area you should stay up to date with the state of the art in both methods of attack and mitigation\",\"however this requirement should not be understood to cover manipulations of a technical nature which take place in the course of the transmission as such manipulations do not alter the integrity of the information transmitted\",\"the benefits risks and harms discussed in this dp are neither exhaustive nor applicable to every ai use case\",\"adversarial attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the ai systems digital assets or the underlying ict infrastructure\",\"once you have secured budget youll need to allow enough time and resources to conduct a substantial discovery to show feasibility\",\"for some of these you will be able to buy or adapt commercially available products\",\"are there any limitationsassumptions to the research\",\"however you still need to comply with the main transparency requirements\",\"at the same time guidance available before publication of this ai rmf does not comprehensively address many ai system risks\",\"equipped with high res still video and infrared cameras the drones are deployed to assess the steelwork wear and corrosion and faults such as damaged conductors\",\"in most cases the design building and running of ai systems will be provided at least in part by third parties that you may not always have a contractual relationship with\",\"if your organisation is a central government department you may have to get approval from the gds to spend money on ai\",\"some possible measures which you could use to identify evaluate minimise monitor and control those risks\",\"you are not required to eliminate every risk identified\",\"making your algorithm accessible is not enough to make your research transparent\",\"also your existing systems need to be integrated with several other new and existing it components which are also intricately connected\",\"where ai systems are partly or wholly outsourced to external providers both you and any other organisations involved should also assess whether joint controllership exists under article  of the uk gdpr and if so collaborate in the dpia process as appropriate\",\"therefore it may sometimes be more appropriate to choose different lawful bases for your ai development and deployment\",\"in some cases it may be appropriate for an independent ethics review to be conducted before deployment\",\"while a non binding instrument would be less intrusive it is unlikely toaddress the identified problems in an effective manner\",\"box  what do we mean by technology neutral\",\"any platforms your team will use to collate the technology used across the ai project to help speed up ai deployment\",\"however the commission could adopt common technical specifications in areas where no harmonised standards exist or where they are insufficient\",\"they may also use other sources available for use at a distance which offer a similar degree of reliability for the purpose of complying with this obligation\",\"the national disabled law students association expressed concerns that individuals with disabilities were more likely to be flagged as potentially suspicious by remote proctoring ai systems because of their disability specific access needs such as needing longer breaks or using screen readers or dictation software\",\"however a digital form requiring manual input might be more accurate quicker to build and cheaper\",\"maintain a cross functional team\",\"our guidance says that you are likely to be a processor if you dont have any purpose of your own for processing the data and you only act on a clients instructions\",\"the code is open source\",\"as these models alone do not constitute a complete ai system the distribution of open source software would not be subject to obligations regarding making available for use\",\"the examples we have highlighted above are both black box attacks\",\"however some lawful bases may be more likely to be appropriate for the training and  or deployment of ai than others\",\"have you enabled an open and transparent system to allow stakeholders to ask questions throughout the research process\",\"for the development of potentially life saving ai systems it would be better to rely on other lawful bases\",\"in particular iosco recommends the implementation of kill switch functionality in the control framework which is similar to the existing expectations and requirements for algorithmic trading in ss and commission delegated regulation eu\",\"this decision is dependent on your infrastructure and user requirements\",\"these harms rarely arise as a result of a deliberate choice most ai developers do not want to build biased or discriminatory applications or applications which invade users privacy\",\"in such a case costs would be at most as high as for high risk ai systems but most probably lower\",\"what can you do to try and protect against this possibility\",\"you cannot delegate these issues to data scientists or engineering teams\",\"in doing so we will not publish your name or contact details or any information which may personally identify you\",\"it is also worth noting firms and fmis are expected to andor required to meet applicable operational resilience requirements and expectations irrespective of whether the ai is developed in house or by third parties\",\"the most serious cases of non compliance could be prosecuted at the discretion of the public prosecution service of canada ppsc\",\"the firm has been using six drones for the past two years to help inspect its  miles of overhead lines around england and wales\",\"the constraint is that ml models need to be sufficiently small and computationally efficient to run on the users own hardware\",\"you can consider whether the team has validated the code\",\"depending on the circumstances your use of ai systems is also likely to rely heavily on third party code relationships with suppliers or both\",\"the following hypothetical scenarios are intended to raise awareness of some of the known security risks and challenges that ai can exacerbate\",\"you should consider these issues as part of your dpia for any system you intend to use\",\"however avoiding overfitting will not completely eliminate the risks\",\"working in this way means you can launch new improvements without worrying about functionality once deployed\",\"for legacy systems to be compatible with ai technology you will often need to invest a lot of work to bring your legacy systems up to modern standards\",\"however there are methods you can use to assess and mitigate trade offs that are relevant to many use cases\",\"are there any improvements that could be made to the current approach\",\"when you either buy an ai solution from a third party or outsource it altogether you need to conduct an independent evaluation of any trade offs as part of your due diligence process\",\"for example businesses involved only in the design or development of a high impact ai system but with no practical ability to monitor the system after the development would have different obligations from those managing its operations\",\"if you use a processor you can illustrate some of the more technical elements of the processing activity in a dpia by reproducing information from that processor\",\"as far as possible they will also seek to work with existing processes rather than creating new ones\",\"in light of their digital nature certain ai systems should fall within the scope of this regulation even when they are neither placed on the market nor put into service nor used in the union\",\"if you dont have any purpose of your own for processing the data and you only act on a clients instructions you are likely to be a processor  even if you make some technical decisions about how you process the data\",\"provide common environments for sharing data and code so the team can work collaboratively\",\"consider available technical approaches to minimise the need for any trade offs\",\"however it would not apply to ai systems developed or used exclusively for military purposes\",\"identifying constraints in real world applications that may lead to negative impacts\",\"a non professional user that buys an aisystem and simply launches it according to its purpose without interfering materiallywith the conditions of operations should not be covered by the causality presumptionlaid down by this directive\",\"consider any techniques which you can implement with a reasonable level of investment and effort\",\"each year  testers conduct  million mot tests in  garages across great britain\",\"these harms rarely arise as a result of a deliberate choice most ai developers do not want to build biased or discriminatory applications or applications which invade users privacy\",\"only the largest companies can deal with the resulting compliance

the broader enforcement powers under the aida\",\"process based governance framework\",\"this is narrower than the personal information protection and electronic documents acts pipeda application to all organizations that collect use or disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities except where there is substantively similar provincial legislation\",\"it is not the responsibility of the machine or system to be considerate of these ideals\",\"further the aida provides the minister with broad order making powers and audit rights\",\"there are three elements to the

primary and secondary legislation whereas soft law as non binding quasi legal instruments\",\"in the case of federated learning participating organisations may be considered joint controllers even

missions\",\"this decentralised sectoral approach is similar to the sectoral approach of the uk\",\"the framework is a tool that should be used in any project\",\"a large majority of stakeholders agree that legislative gaps exist or that new legislation is needed\",\"the ml framework depends on a number of specialist open source programming libraries which needed to be downloaded on the recruiters it system\",\"both the eu and the canadian approach to risk entail horizontal risk frameworks with some vertical components\",\"the alan turing institute calls it a pbg framework\",\"they include among others systems that predict a persons risk of committing a crime or that automate hiring decisions such as sorting resumes or cvs as defined in annex iii\",\"additionally this framework does not analyze or take a position on legislative and regulatory proposals in municipal state and federal government or those in other countries\",\"in substance the resolutions are complementary in many aspects\",\"however some differ in their stringency\",\"similarly linear relationships where the value of the output increases proportional to the input may be easier to interpret than relationships that are non linear where the output value is not proportional to the input or non monotonic where the output value may increase or decrease as the input increases\",\"the prudential regimes eg solvency ii tend to lay out high level principles on data without prescribing detailed guidelines on their implementation\",\"for example the equality of opportunity monitoring provision mentioned above cannot be relied on in such contexts because the processing is carried out for the purposes of decisions about a particular individual\",\"for instance the equalities and human rights commission has powers to provide guidance on equalities law while the competition and markets authority has powers related to consumer law and competition\",\"the framework explicates how enforcement should be undertaken for non compliance for both institutions and individuals\",\"overall the aida would apply to persons including trusts joint ventures partnerships unincorporated associations and any other legal entities who carry out any of the regulated activities as specified above\",\"if you are processing special categories of data you need both a lawful basis and an additional condition

expanding scale of private data collection or of the ability of governments at all levels to access that data and leverage the means of private collection\",\"pra ss algorithmic trading sets out expectations for governance eg cross lines of defence coordination smfs testing with regard to the use of algorithms in the context of trading\",\"however where there are relevant differences between the requirements of the regimes these are explained in the text\",\"process based governance framework\",\"it is important to note that activities such as research or the development of methodologies are not in themselves regulated activities under aida\",\"that framework should therefore be preserved\",\"for example smaller firms would not be expected to have governance structures policies and procedures comparable to those of larger firms with a greater number of employees and a wider range of activities\",\"for example the theory of differential privacy provides a framework for quantifying and minimising trade offs between the knowledge that can be gained from a dataset or statistical model and the privacy of the people in it\",\"these frameworks have some features in common

not all financial and demographic features will be useful to predict credit risk\",\"additionally the proposal does not amend sector specific legislation or the enforcement and governance mechanisms set thereunder but provides for a horizontal framework to rely on for aspects beyond specific content or subcategories of services regulated in sector specific acts\",\"the former would apply to the private sector while the latter applies to government institutions\",\"thisobjective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states because the relevantinternal market obstacles are linked to the risk of unilateral and fragmented regulatorymeasures at national level\",\"in the context of this framework such domains are considered sensitive whether or not the specifics of a system context would necessitate coverage under existing law and domains and data that are considered sensitive are understood to change over time based on societal norms and context\",\"the proposal does not foresee the automatic creation of any additional bodies or authorities at member state level\",\"the alan turing institute calls these the sum values\",\"each of these further applications might require a different lawful basis\",\"title vi sets up the governance systems at union and national level\",\"the aida also exempts the federal government from its application\",\"the proposal sets a robust and flexible legal framework\",\"while the principles are non binding and horizontal the bor provides guidance on how they can be enforced by existing federaland state level sectoral legislation as well as federal agency led activities amongst others\",\"in terms of horizontal components it differentiates between unacceptable risk high risk limited risk minimal or no risk ai systems\",\"first we designed the categories to be sufficiently general to capture a full breadth of approaches eg centralised or decentralised hard or soft law approaches\",\"underserved communities the term underserved communities refers to communities that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic social and civic life as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of equity the below examples are meant to illustrate the breadth of automated systems that insofar as they have the potential to meaningfully impact rights opportunities or access to critical resources or services should be covered by the blueprint for an ai bill of rights\",\"government applications particularly law enforcement applications or applications that raise national security considerations may require confidential or limited engagement based on system sensitivities and preexisting oversight laws and structures\",\"with all of these definitions it is important to note that while both algorithms and models may be components of an ai system they may not in themselves necessarily be deemed to be ai\",\"for banks the general organisational requirements part  states that firms must have robust governance arrangements which include a clear organisational structure with well defined transparent and consistent lines of responsibility and effective control and safeguard arrangements for information processing systems\",\"in some cases more than one lawful basis may be appropriate\",\"map  context is established and
