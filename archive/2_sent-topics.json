shall assign a single number even where a body is notified under several union acts\",\"they may also include corrective measures such as discontinuing advertising revenue for specific content or

specific new legislative framework legislation\",\"especially where those measures can affect the rights and interests of third parties as may be the case in particular where the access to online interfaces is restricted it is appropriate to require that the measures be ordered by a competent judicial authority at the digital service coordinators request and are subject to additional

obligations\",\"therefore prior to making their ai systems available in the union where an importer cannot be identified providers established outside the union shall by written mandate appoint an authorised representative established in the union\",\"in view of the different nature of the activities of mere conduit caching and hosting and the different position and abilities of the providers of the services in question it is necessary to distinguish the rules applicable to those activities in so far as under this regulation they are subject to different requirements and conditions and

disabling of access to it\",\"these criminal offences are completely separate from the regulatory obligations and related offences discussed in the previous section\",\"ballot curing processes vary among states and include direct phone calls emails or mail contact by election officials\",\"the relevant rules of chapter ii should only establish when the provider of intermediary services concerned cannot be held liable in relation to illegal content provided by the recipients of the service\",\"they will also monitor compliance of operators with their relevant obligations under the regulation\",\"section  lays down obligations applicable to all providers of intermediary services in particular the obligation to establish a single point of contact to facilitate direct communication with member states authorities the commission and the board article  the obligation to designate a legal representative in the union for providers not established in any member state but offering their services in the union article  the obligation to set out in their terms and conditions any restrictions that they may impose on the use of their services and to act responsibly in applying and enforcing those restrictions article  and transparency reporting obligations in relation to the removal and the disabling of information considered to be illegal content or contrary to the providers terms and conditions article\",\"this approach is fully reflected in the interplay between this regulation and the machinery regulation\",\"in respect of providers that do not have an establishment in the union but that offer services in the union and therefore fall within the scope of this regulation the member state where those providers appointed their legal representative should have jurisdiction considering the function of legal representatives under this regulation\",\"a provider of intermediary services which does not have an establishment in the union but which offers services in the union shall for the purposes of chapters iii and iv be deemed to be under the jurisdiction of the member state where its legal representative resides or is established\",\"this has led over the years to a lack of trust between member states in addressing concerns about providers offering digital services cross border\",\"nothing in this regulation should be construed as an imposition of a general monitoring obligation or active fact finding obligation or as a general obligation for providers to take proactive measures to relation to illegal content\",\"providers of intermediary services should not be subject to a monitoring obligation with respect to obligations of a general nature\",\"when it comes to enforcement there is a general understanding among stakeholders that cooperation between authorities should be improved both cross border and within each member state\",\"importers shall indicate their name registered trade name or registered trade mark and the address at which they can be contacted on the high risk ai system or where that is not possible on its packaging or its accompanying documentation as applicable\",\"this regulation is also without prejudice to the rules of union law on working conditions\",\"however the mere fact that certain conditions for accessing a particular space may apply such as admission tickets or age restrictions does not mean that the space is not publicly accessible within the meaning of this regulation\",\"a provider should be under the jurisdiction of the member state where its main establishment is located that is where the provider has its head office or registered office within which the principal financial functions and operational control are exercised\",\"prior to making their systems available on the union market where an importer cannot be identified providers established outside the union shall by written mandate appoint an authorised representative which is established in the union\",\"a well coordinated supervisory system reinforced at union level also ensures a coherent approach applicable to providers of intermediary services operating in all member states\",\"the new regulation prohibits general monitoring obligations as they could disproportionately limit users freedom of expression and freedom to receive information and could burden service providers excessively and thus unduly interfere with their freedom to conduct a business\",\"where a provider of intermediary services fails to appoint a legal representative in accordance with article  all member states shall have jurisdiction for the purposes of chapters iii and iv\",\"when public authorities and notified bodies need to be given access to confidential information or source code to examine compliance with substantial obligations they are placed under binding confidentiality obligations\",\"in order to ensure that those orders can be complied with in an effective and efficient manner so that the public authorities concerned can carry out their tasks and the providers are not subject to any disproportionate burdens without unduly affecting the rights and legitimate interests of any third parties it is necessary to set certain conditions that those orders should meet and certain complementary requirements relating to the processing of those orders\",\"paragraphs   and  shall not affect the requirements and obligations set out in title iii of this regulation\",\"in order to increase organisation efficiency on the side of member states and to set an official point of contact vis  vis the public and other counterparts at member state and union levels in each member state one national authority should be designated as national supervisory authority\",\"notifying authorities shall safeguard the confidentiality of the information they obtain\",\"while data protection and ai ethics overlap this guidance does not provide generic ethical or design principles for your use of ai\",\"therefore orders about information on a group of recipients of the service who are not specifically identified including orders to provide aggregate information required for statistical purposes or evidence based policy making should remain unaffected by the rules of this regulation on the provision of information\",\"in addition member states should lay down and notify to the commission the rules on penalties including administrative fines and ensure that they are properly and effectively implemented by the date of application of this regulation\",\"full consistency is ensured with existing sectoral union legislation applicable to ai systems eg\",\"at the national level member states will have to designate one or more national competent authorities and among them the national supervisory authority for the purpose of supervising the application and implementation of the regulation\",\"member states should ensure that violations of the obligations laid down in this regulation can be sanctioned in a manner that is effective proportionate and dissuasive taking into account the nature gravity recurrence and duration of the violation in view of the public interest pursued the scope and kind of activities carried out as well as the economic capacity of the infringer\",\"these choicessuch as contextual timely alerts about location trackingare brief direct and use specific\",\"in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out inthat article this directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achievethat objective\",\"in order to benefit from the exemption from liability for hosting services the provider should upon obtaining actual knowledge or awareness of illegal content act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to that content\",\"the ce marking referred to in paragraph  of this article shall be subject to the general principles set out in article  of regulation ec no\",\"in china a mixture of regulatory and non regulatory requirements have been introduced\",\"dissemination to the public means making information available at the request of the recipient of the service who provided the information to a potentially unlimited number of third partiesdistance contract means a contract within the meaning of article  of directive euonline interface means any software including a website or a part thereof and applications including mobile applicationsdigital services coordinator of establishment means the digital services coordinator of the member state where the provider of an intermediary service is established or its legal representative resides or is establisheddigital services coordinator of destination means the digital services coordinator of a member state where the intermediary service is providedadvertisement means information designed to promote the message of a legal or natural person irrespective of whether to achieve commercial or non commercial purposes and displayed by an online platform on its online interface against remuneration specifically for promoting that informationrecommender system means a fully or partially automated system used by an online platform to suggest in its online interface specific information to recipients of the service including as a result of a search initiated by the recipient or otherwise determining the relative order or prominence of information displayedpcontent moderation means the activities undertaken by providers of intermediary services aimed at detecting identifying and addressing illegal content or information incompatible with their terms and conditions provided by recipients of the service including measures taken that affect the availability visibility and accessibility of that illegal content or that information such as demotion disabling of access to or removal thereof or the recipients ability to provide that information such as the termination or suspension of a recipients accountqterms and conditions means all terms and conditions or specifications irrespective of their name or form which govern the contractual relationship between the provider of intermediary services and the recipients of the services\",\"by establishing a clear framework accompanied by cooperation between and with member states as well as by self regulation this proposal aims to enhance legal certainty and increase trust levels while staying relevant and effective in the long term because of the flexibility of the cooperation framework\",\"it does not supersede modify or direct an interpretation of any existing statute regulation policy or international instrument\",\"the section on regulatory requirements also includes a summary table on the role of standards impact assessments and audits\",\"these principles are not intended to and do not prohibit or limit any lawful activity of a government agency including law enforcement national security or intelligence activities\",\"the illegal nature of such content products or services is not defined in this regulation but results from union law or from national law in accordance with union law\",\"proportionate to the obligations and taking into account the cross border nature of digital services the proposal will introduce a cooperation mechanism across member states with enhanced union level oversight of very large online platforms\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"Regulation of intermediary

understand the benefits that ai can bring to organisations and individuals but there are risks too\",\"potential pitfalls when seeking to measure negative risk or harms include the reality that development of metrics is often an institutional endeavor and may inadvertently reflect factors unrelated to the underlying impact\",\"this guidance covers both the ai and data protection specific risks and the implications of those risks for governance and accountability\",\"therefore the most appropriate smfs may depend on the organisational structure of the firm its risk profile and the areas or use cases where ai is deployed within the firm\",\"it uses knowledge relevant to ai risks identified in the map function and informs the manage function\",\"manage  risk treatments including response and recovery and communication plans for the identified and measured ai risks are documented and monitored regularly\",\"different organizations may have varied risk tolerances due to their particular organizational priorities and resource considerations\",\"however since many of the risk controls that you may need to adopt are context specific we cannot include an exhaustive or definitive list\",\"importantly the uk also specifies that the risk of missed opportunities eg of not using the technologies should be considered something that is reflective of its overarching pro innovation approach\",\"while some ai risks and benefits are well known it can be challenging to assess negative impacts and the degree of harms\",\"govern  organizational teams are committed to a culture that considers and communicates ai risk\",\"measures must be taken to mitigate the risk of harm\",\"data  given that ai relies significantly on large volumes of data in its development training and testing and implementation data related risks can be amplified and have significant implications for ai systems\",\"ai risks  and benefits  can emerge from the interplay of technical aspects combined with societal factors related to how a system is used its interactions with other ai systems who operates it and the social context in which it is deployed\",\"these factors span safety ethical legal and administrative concerns and include data quality the success of your ai project depends on the quality of your data\",\"whether a system using ai is generally more or less risky than a system not using ai depends on the specific circumstances\",\"ai safety risk management approaches should take cues from efforts and guidelines for safety in fields such as transportation and healthcare and align with existing sectoror application specific guidelines or standards\",\"in many cases choosing between different risk management approaches will require trade offs\",\"ai risk management efforts should consider that humans may assume that ai systems work and work well in all settings\",\"both of these risks are active areas of research and their likelihood and severity are the subject of debate and investigation\",\"actionable risk management efforts lay out clear guidelines for assessing trustworthiness of each ai system an organization develops or deploys\",\"you should assign a score or level to each risk measured against the likelihood and the severity of the impact on individuals\",\"design decisions take socio technical implications into account to address ai risks\",\"regardless all parties and ai actors should manage risk in the ai systems they develop deploy or use as standalone or integrated components\",\"this vision is complemented by the cdeis ai assurance guide  which guides practitioners about how different assurance techniques such as bias audits and risk assessments can be applied to ai\",\"risk treatment comprises plans to respond to recover from and communicate about incidents or events\",\"enhanced organizational culture which prioritizes the identification and management of ai system risks and potential impacts to individuals communities organizations and society\",\"ai rmf temporal profiles are descriptions of either the current state or the desired target state of specific ai risk management activities within a given sector industry organization or application context\",\"in contrast to the horizontal approach by the eu and canada the usa and uk focus more on the sectoral impact of these technologies where ai risks are treated as domain specific and there is no overarching legally binding risk framework\",\"the rmf expands the oecds framework for the classification of ai  to delineate specific risks that may emerge at each phase of the lifecycle the lifecycle is broken down to five dimensions which each contain lifecycle stages application context eg\",\"governance  at the governance level the drivers of risk can include the absence of clearly defined roles and responsibilities for ai insufficient skillsets governance functions that do not include the relevant business areas or consider the relevant risks such as ethical risks a lack of challenge at the board and executive level and general lack of accountability\",\"once tolerance is defined this ai rmf can be used to manage risks and to document risk management processes\",\"attention to governance is a continual and intrinsic requirement for effective ai risk management over an ai systems lifespan and the organizations hierarchy\",\"contextual information gleaned from expert consultation and input from relevant ai actors  established in govern and carried out in map  is utilized in this function to decrease the likelihood of system failures and negative impacts\",\"govern  organizational policies and practices are in place to collect consider prioritize and integrate feedback from those external to the team that developed or deployed the ai system regarding the potential individual and societal impacts related to ai risks\",\"organizations and other users of the framework are encouraged to periodically evaluate whether the ai rmf has improved their ability to manage ai risks including but not limited to their policies processes practices implementation plans indicators measurements and expected outcomes\",\"it is about ensuring that these risks are identified managed and mitigated\",\"however ai may also lead to risks to system resilience and efficiency\",\"measure  risk tracking approaches

accountability\",\"another area for consideration is the possible negative impacts of systemic risks on society and democracy such as disinformation or manipulative and abusive activities\",\"nonetheless regularly assessing and prioritizing risk based on context remains important because non human facing ai systems can have downstream safety or social implications\",\"in this section we focus on the way ai can adversely affect security by making known risks worse and more challenging to control\",\"our key message is that you should review your risk management practices ensuring personal data is secure in an ai context\",\"models  poor ai model performance may result from data related risks but also from a range of model related risks\",\"three categories of systemic risks should be assessed in depth\",\"taking a risk based approach means assessing the risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals that may arise when you use ai\",\"we will continue to monitor and review these risks and may update this guidance accordingly\",\"safetysafety means that high impact ai systems must be proactively assessed to identify harms that could result from use of the system including through reasonably foreseeable misuse\",\"framework users may apply these functions as best suits their needs for managing ai risks based on their resources and capabilities\",\"in this section we focus on risk as an umbrella concept that broadly captures a jurisdictions approach to dealing with future uncertainties related to the design development and deployment of ai systems\",\"govern  roles and responsibilities and lines of communication related to mapping measuring and managing ai risks are documented and are clear to individuals and teams throughout the organization\",\"in addition to the white house and congress efforts the national institute of standards and technology nist released the ai risk management framework rmf in january\",\"ai risk management approaches for human ai configurations will be augmented by ongoing research and evaluation\",\"when managing ai risks organizations can face difficult decisions in balancing these characteristics\",\"some companies have put in place safeguards that have prevented harm from occurring by ensuring that key development decisions are vetted by an ethics review others have identified and mitigated harms found through pre deployment testing and ongoing monitoring processes\",\"the rmf aims to foster the development of innovative approaches to the management of ai risks including the use of impact assessments\",\"risk response options can include mitigating transferring avoiding or accepting\",\"article risk assessmentvery large online platforms shall identify analyse and assess from the date of application referred to in the second subparagraph of article  at least once a year thereafter any significant systemic risks stemming from the functioning and use made of their services in the union\",\"ai applications can exacerbate existing risks introduce new ones or generally make risks more difficult to assess or manage\",\"the draft ai act also asks that a risk assessment is conducted with respect to whether a system is high risk and to assess systemic risks respectively and that this assessment should be agile iterative and constantly adapting to the changing nature of technology and systemic risks\",\"it describes four specific functions to help organizations address the risks of ai systems in practice\",\"in addition small to medium sized organizations managing ai risks or implementing the ai rmf may face different challenges than large organizations depending on their capabilities and resources\",\"inscrutable ai systems can

three key areas in the ai lifecycle see figure  below that can introduce novel challenges and increase existing risks\",\"nist described several key attributes of the ai rmf when work on the framework first began\",\"the proposal is part of a wider comprehensive package of measures that address problems posed by the development and use of ai as examined in the white paper on ai\",\"one prominent area of ai is machine learning ml which is the use of computational techniques to create often complex statistical models using typically large quantities of data\",\"your ai systems real world impact\",\"different ai actors have different responsibilities and awareness depending on their roles in the lifecycle\",\"however they are more likely to occur in ai systems because they can include a greater number of features and may identify complex combinations of features which are proxies for protected characteristics\",\"representative ai actors across the lifecycle dimensions are listed in figure  and described in detail in appendix a\",\"key participants across the ai value chain are also clearly defined such as providers and users of ai systems that cover both public and private operators to ensure a level playing field\",\"the core messages gleaned from these discussions include that ai has transformative potential to improve americans lives and that preventing the harms of these technologies is both necessary and achievable\",\"manage  mechanisms are in place and applied and responsibilities are assigned and understood to supersede disengage or deactivate ai systems that demonstrate performance or outcomes inconsistent with intended use\",\"ai system scale and complexity many systems contain billions or even trillions of decision points housed within more traditional software applications\",\"while there is no consensus on a single definition it is generally accepted that ai is the simulation of human intelligence by machines including the use of computer systems which have the ability to perform tasks that demonstrate learning decision making problem solving and other tasks which previously required human intelligence\",\"many of the issues related to ai are not new and apply to other data analytics modelling techniques and technologies\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"Impact of AI in

is required to undergo a third party conformity assessment with a view to the placing on the market or putting into service of that product pursuant to the union harmonisation legislation listed in annex ii\",\"the notion of ai system should be clearly defined to ensure legal certainty while providing the flexibility to accommodate future technological developments\",\"title ix creates a framework for the creation of codes of conduct which aim to encourage providers of non high risk ai systems to apply voluntarily the mandatory requirements for high risk ai systems as laid out in title iii\",\"indeed the proposal defines common mandatory requirements applicable to the design and development of certain ai systems before they are placed on the market that will be further operationalised through harmonised technical standards\",\"for high risk ai systems that continue to learn after being placed on the market or put into service changes to the high risk ai system and its performance that have been pre determined by the provider at the moment of the initial conformity assessment and are part of the information contained in the technical documentation referred to in point  of annex iv shall not constitute a substantial modification\",\"therefore the classification as high risk does not only depend on the function performed by the ai system but also on the specific purpose and modalities for which that system is used\",\"this regulation shall apply to the high risk ai systems other than the ones referred to in paragraph  that have been placed on the market or put into service before date of application of this regulation referred to in article  only if from that date those systems are subject to significant changes in their design or intended

algorithmic discrimination avoid meaningful harm and achieve equity goals\",\"however this may not eradicate the bias completely and can in some instances worsen the problem as correlated attributes still existent in the data may still reflect the bias you are trying to erase\",\"additionally harmful bias and other data quality issues can affect ai system trustworthiness which could lead to negative impacts\",\"throughout the recruitment process and in the evaluation promotion or retention of persons in work related contractual relationships such systems may perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination for example against women certain age groups persons with disabilities or persons of certain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation\",\"such data should be sufficiently robust to identify and help to mitigate biases and potential harms\",\"bias exists in many forms and can become ingrained in the automated systems that help make decisions about our lives\",\"fairnessaccountabilitysustainabilitytransparencyensure your project is fair and prevent bias or discrimination\",\"for example an ai system used to predict loan repayment rates is likely to breach the fairness principle if it makes predictions which frequently turn out to be incorrect\",\"this process discriminated against black patients who generally have less access to medical care and therefore have generated less cost than white patients with similar illness and need\",\"for instance the aaa would direct the federal trade commission ftc to require covered entities that sell or use automated decision systems and augmented critical decision processes to complete impact assessments including accuracy fairness bias and discrimination\",\"biased cultural assumptions of developers\",\"but there is much more work to do to protect the public from algorithmic discrimination and to use and design automated systems in an equitable way\",\"unfortunately this also includes detecting patterns of discrimination using complex combinations of features which might be correlated with protected characteristics in non obvious ways\",\"the techniques it proposes do not necessarily align with relevant non discrimination law in the uk and in some cases may contradict it so should not be relied upon as a means of complying with such obligations\",\"however these may also include patterns that reflect discrimination\",\"however if the examples of employees used to train the model were discriminated against on those grounds eg by being systematically under rated in performance reviews the algorithm may learn to reproduce that discrimination by inferring those characteristics from proxy data contained in the job application despite the designer never intending it

the correct population as possible\",\"if your ai system processes social or demographic data you should design it to meet a minimum level of discriminatory non harm\",\"for ai systems you need to think about any detriment to individuals that could follow from bias or inaccuracy in the algorithms and data sets being used\",\"personalisation eg pricing specific to individual consumers could also lead to some financial products not being offered to certain groups potentially resulting in unlawful discrimination based on protected characteristics\",\"fairness are the models trained and tested on relevant accurate and generalisable datasets and is the ai system deployed by users trained to implement them responsibly and without bias\",\"if potential bias is identified ensure that this is documented to enable informed interpretation of results\",\"any processing of personal data using ai that leads to unjust discrimination between people will violate the fairness principle\",\"an explanation of any relevant variation or margins of error in the performance of the system which may affect the fairness of the personal data processing see what do we need to do about statistical accuracy\",\"in particular if the ai system is not trained with high quality data does not meet adequate requirements in terms of its accuracy or robustness or is not properly designed and tested before being put on the market or otherwise put into service it may single out people in a discriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner\",\"this is also true for dpos and senior staff in oversight functions as they will be expected to provide ongoing advice and guidance on the appropriateness of any measures and safeguards put in place to mitigate discrimination risk\",\"computational and statistical biases can be present in ai datasets and algorithmic processes and often stem from systematic errors due to non representative samples\",\"in cases of imbalanced training data it may be possible to balance it out by adding or removing data about under overrepresented subsets of the population eg adding more data points on loan applications from women\",\"standards of fairness can be complex and difficult to define because perceptions of fairness differ among cultures and may shift depending on application\",\"any automated system should be tested to help ensure it is free from

potentially discriminatory ai systems include prejudices or bias in the way variables are measured labelled or aggregated\",\"the equal employment opportunity commission and the department of justice have clearly laid out how employers use of ai and other automated systems can result in discrimination against job applicants and employees with disabilities\",\"in this case the ai system puts

algorithmic impact assessments described as part of algorithmic discrimination protections\",\"in order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and freedoms of

the principles or fca rules and be subject to action from the fca\",\"algorithmic biasthis is the bias that occurs when the algorithm being used is faulty for example there may be technical issues with the algorithm stopping it from working or not being used in the way it was intended and therefore not appropriate for the new application\",\"they may violate the right to dignity and non discrimination and the values of equality and justice\",\"were there any limitations or biases in the training data that may have affected the results\",\"this field is often referred to as algorithmic fairness\",\"if a cv filtering system being used to assist with selecting qualified candidates for an interview produces a false positive then an unqualified candidate may be invited to interview wasting the employers and the applicants time unnecessarily\",\"these proxy variables enable the model to reproduce patterns of discrimination associated with those characteristics even if its designers did not intend this\",\"for example if the system amplifies the underlying correlation or produces unfair results for specific individuals based on the prohibited grounds this would not be considered justified\",\"in order to assess and address the potential for discrimination in an ai system you may need a dataset containing example individuals with labels for the protected

by an ai system and that adversely differentiates in relation to an individual on one or more of the prohibited grounds of discrimination set out in the canadian human rights act or on a combination of such prohibited grounds however biased output will not include content or a decision recommendation or prediction the purpose and effect of which are to prevent disadvantages that are likely to be suffered by or to eliminate or reduce disadvantages that are suffered by any group of individuals when those disadvantages would be based on or related to prohibited grounds\",\"the methodology shall

provide a comparison of numerous governments approaches to ai regulatory policy\",\"accordingly future regulatory policy in china will likely come from a combination of initiatives covering science and technology research in general as well as measures more specifically focused on the development and use of ai technologies\",\"the modalities and the conditions of the operation of the ai regulatory sandboxes including the eligibility criteria and the procedure for the application selection participation and exiting from the sandbox and the rights and obligations of the participants shall be set out in implementing acts\",\"these examples illustrate the usas emphasis on the enforcement of existing sectoral regulations adapted to ai\",\"regarding regulatory measures these have mostly been introduced by the cac and have focused on specific ai technologies\",\"while this report focuses on applying our comparative framework to these five early mover jurisdictions we designed the categories to be jurisdiction agnostic and robust to future policy developments\",\"their supervisory function could build on existing arrangements for example regarding conformity assessment bodies or market surveillance but would require sufficient technological expertise and human and financial resources\",\"this dp should also be considered within the context of the evolving wider national and international policy debate on ai including the uk governments policy paper establishing a pro innovation approach to regulating aiopens in a new window joint working between uk regulators through the digital regulation cooperation forum drcf and international developments from other regulators and authorities such as the proposed ai regulation for the eu\",\"in particular the supervisory authorities are interested in the additional challenges and risks that ai brings to firms decision making and governance processes and how those may be addressed through the senior managers and certification regime smcr and other existing regulatory tools\",\"member states competent authorities that have established ai regulatory sandboxes shall coordinate their activities and cooperate within the framework of the european artificial intelligence board\",\"one of the most significant questions is whether ai can be managed through clarifications of the existing regulatory framework or whether a new approach is needed\",\"the ai and data commissioner would assess the progress of the ecosystem over time and ensure that administration and enforcement activities take into account the capabilities and scale of impact of regulated organizations\",\"the minister of innovation science and industry would be empowered to administer and enforce the act to ensure that policy and enforcement move together as the technology evolves\",\"this is particularly true now while ai adoption is still in its initial stages and the technology itself as well as the associated laws regulations governance and risk management best practices are still developing quickly\",\"governance related legal requirements and guidance including notably the smcr are focused on proper procedures clear accountability and effective risk management across the ai lifecycle at various levels of operations\",\"it also includes discussion of how financial services regulation sits alongside a body of cross sectoral legislation and regulation as well as the domestic and international context of emerging ai specific legal requirements and guidance\",\"additionally they ask that regulators consider lighter touch options such as guidance or voluntary measures in the first instance\",\"against this political context the commission puts forward the proposed regulatory framework on artificial intelligence with the following specific objectives ensure that ai systems placed on the union market and used are safe and respect existing law on fundamental rights and union valuesensure legal certainty to facilitate investment and innovation in aienhance governance and effective enforcement of existing law on fundamentalrights and safety requirements applicable to ai systemsfacilitate the development of a single market for lawful safe and trustworthy ai applications and prevent market fragmentation\",\"annex  sets out an overview of certain key existing legal requirements and guidance relevant to data and ai\",\"understanding the similarities and differences between different governments approaches is an important first step for promoting deeper cooperation and improved interoperability of regulatory frameworks for ai\",\"the uk approach is context based and sector led with regulators asked to apply their existing powers and expertise to ai focusing on light touch options in the first instance\",\"in china monitoring and enforcement is also conducted by a variety of regulators each with different responsibilities and often taking different approaches\",\"subsidiaritythe objectives of this proposal cannot be adequately achieved at national level becauseemerging divergent national rules would increase legal uncertainty and fragmentationcreating obstacles to the rollout of ai enabled products and services across the internalmarket\",\"exclusion criteria governance initiatives that do not include a hard or soft regulatory element that are drafted by sub national or non governmental bodies or that do not specifically focus on ai in any part of the document\",\"furthermore while self regulatory initiatives have generally shown positive results they cannot be legally enforced nor do they cover all participants in the digital economy\",\"regulatory fitness and simplificationthe impact assessment accompanying this proposal identifies the sole added value of union intervention addressing the risk of legal fragmentation triggered by divergent regulatory and supervisory approaches hence without accounting for the increased safety and trust on digital services in a possible increase of cross border digital trade of  to  ie\",\"another hard law policy introduced recently by the cac is the draft provisions on the administration of deep synthesis internet information services  which seek to regulate generative algorithms such as those that create deepfakes\",\"the government will take an agile approach to ai regulation in the coming years by developing and evaluating regulations and guidelines in close collaboration with stakeholders on a regular cycle and adapting enforcement to the needs of the changing environment\",\"overall the main aims that can be inferred from various ai regulatory policies are to preserve national security and stability protect the public interest and the interests of citizens qua consumers and to stimulate the healthy development of ai technologies\",\"this will include strategies that dont specify ai governance approach eg\",\"while ai governance initiatives are still nascent distinct approaches to regulatory policy appear to be emerging in different jurisdictions\",\"while this document considers science and technology in general it is indicative of further regulatory measures being introduced and review bodies established that apply to ai research and development\",\"the purpose of this project is to fill the gap between these two approaches by developing an accessible comparative framework that captures the key similarities and differences in governments approaches to regulatory policy for governing ai we use the term regulatory policy in line with the oecds definition of the use of regulations laws and other instruments to deliver better economic and social outcomes regulatory policy as understood here includes both hard and soft law initiatives which aim to create rules or guidance for designing developing andor deploying ai\",\"legal compliance has relevant regulation been considered in relation to the dataset used both in the uk and if necessary overseas\",\"similar to the eu canada put forward an overarching regulatory mechanism to guide its approach to ai regulation that however bifurcates into the proposed aida for the private sector and the adopted directive on automated decision making for the public sector\",\"however ai can pose novel challenges as well as create new regulatory risks or amplify existing ones\",\"in this report we develop a comparative framework that we apply to five governments approaches to ai regulatory policy canada china the european union eu the united kingdom uk and the united states of america usa\",\"congress has not yet passed legislation concerning ai regulation\",\"the choice of a regulation as a legal instrument is justified by the need for a uniform application of the new rules such as definition of ai the prohibition of certain harmful aienabled practices and the classification of certain ai systems\",\"since ai is of general application across all sectors and activities all laws potentially apply to the use of ai and some particularly relating to privacy and ip are already significant considerations\",\"the policy document establishing a pro innovation approach to regulating ai specifies that there should be evidence of real risk rather than hypothetical risks however the document states that it anticipates that regulators will establish risk based criteria and thresholds for the specific contexts that they are regulating\",\"discussion questions for stakeholder inputthis dp seeks to explore whether stakeholders consider the existing sectoral legal requirements and guidance to be sufficient to address the risks and harms associated with ai where there may be gaps in existing legal requirements and guidance andor how any additional intervention may support the safe and responsible adoption of ai in uk financial markets\",\"to that end it encourages national competent authorities to set up regulatory sandboxes and sets a basic framework in terms of governance supervision and liability\",\"in addition to administration and enforcement of the act the commissioners work would include supporting and coordinating with other regulators to ensure consistent regulatory capacity across different contexts as well as tracking and studying of potential systemic effects of ai systems in order to inform administrative and policy decisions\",\"certain member states have already explored the adoption of national rules to ensure that artificial intelligence is safe and is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights obligations\",\"therefore such use and processing should only be possible in as far as it is compatible with the framework set by this regulation without there being scope outside that framework for the competent authorities where they act for purpose of law enforcement to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the grounds listed in article  of directive eu\",\"box  uk government  establishing a pro innovation approach to regulating aithe uk government published the july  policy paper which set out its emerging thinking on its approach to regulating ai\",\"nonetheless this regulation should not hamper the development and use of innovative approaches in the public administration which would stand to benefit from a wider use of compliant and safe ai systems provided that those systems do not entail a high risk to legal and natural persons\",\"cross cutting legal requirements and guidance are relevant primarily to the three key stages of the ai lifecycle  data models and governance\",\"it is likely that member states would have continued applying their own regulatory systems without any common set of principles and that some member states would have continued to have no horizontal rules in place at all\",\"in line with the differing overarching approaches taken to ai risk the regulatory requirements differ within the five jurisdictions\",\"additionally although the usa and china have both taken more decentralised approaches to ai regulatory policy than the eu or canada chinas cyberspace administration has introduced hard law initiatives for specific ai technologies while the usas federal approach has largely relied on voluntary measures or guidance on applying existing sectoral legislation\",\"this includes a greater reliance on vertical regulations ie which applies to only a specific application of ai or a specific sector which are enforced by different regulatory agencies\",\"to overcome these issues we considered the wider context of the documents in our analysis for instance by specifying that some legislation are more likely to pass than others and linking specific regulatory documents that act as reference points for a countrys approach to regulatory policy\",\"international developments in artificial intelligence regulationcountries regions and inter governmental organizations are working on guidance standards regulation and laws specific to ai\",\"the guidance from iosco measure   governance and responsibilities states that regulators should consider requiring firms to have designated senior management responsible for the oversight of ai development testing deployment monitoring and controls\",\"the machinery regulation applies the same definition of ai system as this regulation\",\"each of these regulatory policies introduces different specific requirements or guidance related to public sector use of ai\",\"this comparative framework contains seven categories  definition of ai  key aims  scope and focal areas  approach to risk  regulatory requirements  monitoring and enforcement and  flexibility and revisions\",\"see table a in appendix  for a mapping of the uk government ai regulation principles against the dp chapters and sections\",\"the cyberspace administration of china cac has complemented this overarching soft law approach by releasing hard law measures\",\"however we think firms deploying ai systems need to have a sufficiently strong set of oversight and governance arrangements that make effective use of humans in the decision making loop and review the accuracy of those arrangements\",\"looking forward the publication of the opinion on strengthening the ethics and governance in science and technology indicates that harder regulatory measures may be introduced and enforced by other regulatory bodies within china given the emphasis within the document on improving regulatory frameworks for science and technology research\",\"the usa and the uk take a more decentralised approach relying on the existing powers of regulators rather than establishing new monitoring bodies\",\"in particular a fragmented regulatory environment could create significant barriers for governments seeking to deepen cooperation and organisations looking to deploy responsible ai systems across borders\",\"some of the data and model issues can also have implications for governance\",\"it is specified in the uks policy document establishing a pro innovation approach to regulating ai  that ai will be regulated based on its use and the impact it has on individuals groups and businesses within a particular context and that responsibility will be delegated to regulators for designing and implementing proportionate regulatory responses\",\"to achieve those objectives this proposal presents a balanced and proportionate horizontal regulatory approach to ai that is limited to the minimum necessary requirements to address the risks and problems linked to ai without unduly constraining or hindering technological development or otherwise disproportionately increasing the cost of placing ai solutions on the market\",\"however adopting ai applications may require you to re assess your existing governance and risk management practices\",\"the regulation of ai under the aida will focus on those persons carrying out a regulated activity which means any of the following in the course of international or interprovincial trade and commerceprocessing or making available for use any data relating to human activities for the purpose of designing developing or using an ai system ordesigning developing or making available for use an ai system or managing its operations\",\"national approaches in addressing the problems will only create additional legal uncertainty and barriers and will slow market uptake of ai\",\"the chapter then explores the potential merits of providing a regulatory definition for ai and how regulators in other jurisdictions are approaching this\",\"clear gatekeeper obligations across the eutoday the way in which gatekeepers conduct their businesses is either largely unregulated or based on sets of rules many of which pre date the digital economy\",\"inter operability with legal frameworks in other jurisdictions would also be a key consideration in the development of regulations in order to facilitate canadian companies access to international markets\",\"those investigatory powers aim to complement the commissions possibility to ask digital services coordinators and other member states authorities for assistance for instance by providing information or in the exercise of those powerscompliance with the relevant obligations imposed under this regulation should be enforceable by means of fines and periodic penalty payments\",\"it would also work together with and support other regulators operating in the ai space in order to ensure that canadians are protected in a consistent and effective manner across regulatory contexts\",\"to develop the comparative framework we began with a set of draft categories related to key features of ai regulatory policy\",\"similarly the uk intends to rely largely on the existing powers of regulators to regulate ai systems rather than establishing a new monitoring body for ai regulation\",\"box  the supervisory authorities use of aithe supervisory authorities utilise ai where appropriate to support and enhance their capabilities\",\"at the same time the uk government has sought to develop a national position on regulating ai across all sectors with the publication in july  of a policy paper establishing a pro innovation approach to regulating ai july  policy paper\",\"the supervisory authorities are publishing this dp to further our understanding and to deepen dialogue on how ai may affect our respective objectives\",\"each approach aims to provide clarity of what constitutes ai within the context of a specific regulatory regime and therefore what restrictions and requirements may apply to the use of the technology\",\"in particular national competent authorities shall have a sufficient number of personnel permanently available whose competences and expertise shall include an in depth understanding of artificial intelligence technologies data and data computing fundamental rights health and safety risks and knowledge of existing standards and legal requirements\",\"at the same time there are various challenges to the supervisory authorities providing a more precise definition as the basis for clarification or additional or alternative regulatory requirements\",\"the initial set of regulations would then be published in part  of the canada gazette\",\"while differences in ai regulatory policies are understandable and expected given the different aspirations and governance institutions of each jurisdiction some types of divergence could bring about negative outcomes\",\"over the past three years the ai governance landscape has become considerably more defined with several governments proposing policies for governing ai technologies within their jurisdictions\",\"firstly these countries have been early movers in terms of outlining their distinct approaches to ai governance which may to varying degrees have an influence on the policy decisions made in other jurisdictions secondly they rank highly on many relevant metrics for international influence in the field of ai governance including leading in research and development investment domiciled ai companies and having the foundations necessary for maintaining influence eg an internationally leading education sector\",\"following this we revised the categories iteratively based on a content analysis of published regulatory policies from canada china the eu the uk and the usa as of january\",\"indeed existing consumer protection regulators are already moving to address some of the impacts of ai within their legislative authorities\",\"in this section we analyse how risk is framed or defined in each jurisdictions approach to ai regulatory policy and how if at all a jurisdiction builds a framework for risk management\",\"member states are increasingly introducing or are considering introducing national laws on the matters covered by this regulation imposing in particular diligence requirements for providers of intermediary services\",\"varying your governance for projects using ai\",\"this approach is designed to provide a clear innovation friendly and flexible approach to regulating ai that addresses harms within particular contexts and can be regularly updated\",\"we filtered ai governance documents for relevance based on the following criteria inclusion criteria hard or soft law initiatives that are designed to govern ai technologies which have been drafted or published by a national levelgovernment institution including hard law introduced by national level government institutions inclusiveof both primary and secondary legislation eg\",\"for instance the supervisory authorities would wish to avoid introducing unnecessarily complex or costly rules that can act as a barrier to entry especially for non systemic firms or unintentionally favour larger firms with more resource to manage compliance with complex rulebooks\",\"the regulatory policy requirements related to ai in the usa uk and china are more decentralised but each takes a different approach\",\"however in view of the divergences when transposing and applying the relevant rules at national level and for reasons of clarity and coherence that framework should be incorporated in this regulation\",\"the proposed regulation provides for a cooperation and coordination mechanism for the supervision of the obligations it imposes\",\"title i defines the subject matter of the regulation and the scope of application of the new rules that cover the placing on the market putting into service and use of ai systems\",\"this includes understanding which areas of the current regulatory framework  would benefit from further clarification with respect to ai ii could be extended to better encompass ai and iii could act as a regulatory barrier to the safe and responsible adoption of ai in uk financial services\",\"second we present the comparative framework which considers seven features of the regulatory approach of each of the five jurisdictions\",\"these crimes could be investigated by law enforcement and prosecuted at the discretion of public prosecution service of canadathe path aheadthe aida is one of the first national regulatory frameworks for ai to be proposed\",\"this enhanced information sharing can considerably expand the scope of regulatory review by government compliance and enforcement agencies\",\"at the same time the legal framework includes flexible mechanisms that enable it to be dynamically adapted as the technology evolves and new concerning situations emerge\",\"regulation within this area is more general requiring firms to have strong data architecture and risk management infrastructure\",\"ai regulatory sandboxes establish a controlled environment to test innovative technologies for a limited time on the basis of a testing plan agreed with the competent authorities\",\"the direct applicability of a regulation in accordance with article  tfeu will reduce legal fragmentation and facilitate the development of a single market for lawful safe and trustworthy ai systems\",\"increased reliance on third parties often outside the regulatory perimeter for datasets ai algorithms and other it outsourcing such as cloud computing may amplify systemic risks\",\"the key aim guiding aida is to regulate trade by establishing common requirements applicable across canada for the design development and use of ai systems and to avoid harm by prohibiting certain conduct in relation to ai systems with a specific focus on high impact systems\",\"recognizing that the regulation of this powerful technology is now an emerging international norm many in the field are worried that regulation will be inflexible or that it will unfairly stigmatize their field of work\",\"as with other dps the supervisory authorities may choose to publish the anonymised and aggregated responses to this dp to help inform the public debate on ai\",\"while domestic and international governance initiatives are still nascent distinct approaches to regulatory policy appear to be emerging in different jurisdictions\",\"other financial services regulators and authorities have explicitly noted the importance of proportionality in relation to the regulation of ai\",\"the questions fall under three main categoriessupervisory authorities objectives and remits exploring the best approach to defining andor scoping the characteristics of ai for the purposes of legal requirements and guidance\",\"some member states are already considering national rules to ensure that ai is safe and is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights obligations\",\"member states shall ensure that to the extent the innovative ai systems involve the processing of personal data or otherwise fall under the supervisory remit of other national authorities or competent authorities providing or supporting access to data the national data protection authorities and those other national authorities are associated to the operation of the ai regulatory sandbox\",\"differing national rules may lead to fragmentation of the internal market and decrease legal certainty for operators that develop or use ai systems\",\"in the absence of effective regulation and enforcement they can set the rules of the game without effectively identifying and mitigating the risks and the societal and economic harm they can cause\",\"while there appears to be some thematic overlaps eg on data quality most notably the various regulations differ in focus and scope\",\"however the shortage of ai specialists hampers regulatory work internationally see for example this report by the uks turing institute\",\"this is notably the case for expert panels expert laboratories and reference laboratories in the field of medical devices pursuant to regulation eu  and regulation eu\",\"this emphasis on sector led governance and light touch instruments is designed to ensure comprehensive regulatory coverage and flexibility so that the uk approach can be regularly updated based on new opportunities and risks from ai\",\"uk national ai strategy state or municipal government initiatives eg\",\"to help address this challenge this chapter discusses some parts of the current regulatory framework that are considered by the supervisory authorities to be most relevant to the regulation of ai\",\"prohibit reckless and malicious uses of ai that cause serious harm to canadians and their interests through the creation of new criminal law provisions\",\"there were many comments underlining the importance of a technology neutral and proportionate regulatory framework\",\"regulatory sandboxes could be very useful for the promotion of ai and are welcomed by certain stakeholders especially the business associations\",\"this divergence has the potential to undermine international cooperation on ai governance and bring about challenges for regulatory interoperability\",\"however unlike ai regulation in the eu and canada which has sought to address ai technologies in general the approach taken by the cac has been more targeted at specific types of ai such as recommender systems  and generative algorithms\",\"however the current scope of mrm regulation in the uk is very limited with only principles and regulation in place for the use of models in specific areas or tasks eg internal capital models or stress testing models\",\"due to the uk following a sector led approach to ai governance the specific monitoring and enforcement mechanisms will depend on the powers afforded to each specific regulator\",\"regulatory offences could be prosecuted in more serious cases of non compliance with regulatory obligations\",\"the expert group produced a report innovember that assessed the challenges some characteristics of ai pose to national civilliability rules\",\"document focused on regulatory policies for ai in the defence sector\",\"artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing family of technologies that requires novel forms of regulatory oversight and a safe space for experimentation while ensuring responsible innovation and integration of appropriate safeguards and risk mitigation measures\",\"when necessary for their mandate existing supervision and enforcement authorities will also have the power to request and access any documentation maintained following this regulation and where needed request market surveillance authorities to organise testing of the high risk ai system through technical means\",\"in addition to the policy paper on the uks approach to regulating ai several policy documents have been released by other government bodies\",\"existing comparisons of different governments approaches to ai regulatory policy take the form of repositories most notably the oecd ai observatorys policy tracker or academic analyses that compare two or more jurisdictions repositories are useful for providing an aggregate picture of the different policy documents that have been published however they do not offer an analytical function for understanding the similarities and differences between different jurisdictions\",\"four policy options of different degrees of regulatory intervention were assessedoption  eu legislative instrument setting up a voluntary labelling schemeoption  a sectoral ad hoc approachoption  horizontal eu legislative instrument following a proportionate riskbased approachoption  horizontal eu legislative instrument following a proportionate riskbased approach  codes of conduct for non high risk ai systemsoption  horizontal eu legislative instrument establishing mandatory requirements for all ai systems irrespective of the risk they pose\",\"the supervisory authorities are keen to gather feedback from stakeholders as to whether additional clarification of existing legal requirements and guidance in respect of ai may be helpful if the current regulatory framework could benefit from extension to better encompass ai and how the supervisory authorities may best support the safe and responsible adoption of ai in uk financial services\",\"governance  ai may also pose some novel challenges for governance especially where the technology is used to facilitate autonomous decision making and may limit or even potentially eliminate human judgement and oversight from decisions\",\"although it is too early to assess the likelihood of this type of landscape emerging for ai regulatory policy it is a plausible outcome if distinct or mutually exclusive regulatory requirements are introduced given this as the efforts to introduce ai regulatory policies progress it is vital that stakeholders understand the similarities and differences between governments approaches so that they are able to reasonably assess the possibility of fragmentation and promote deeper cooperation\",\"to this end they should appoint at least one authority with the task to apply and enforce this regulation\",\"given the extent of overlaps within the existing sectoral rules policies and principles in uk financial services that apply to ai the supervisory authorities approach is largely limited to clarifying how the existing regulatory framework applies to ai and addressing any identified gaps in the regulatory framework\",\"however the government is cognizant that developments in ai have created regulatory gaps that must be filled in order for canadians to trust the technology\",\"the law and policy landscape for motor vehicles shows that strong safety regulationsand measures to address harms when they occurcan enhance innovation in the context of complex technologies\",\"additional measures are also proposed to support innovation in particular through ai regulatory sandboxes and other measures to reduce the regulatory burden and to support small and medium sized enterprises smes and start ups\",\"the specific measures required by regulation would be developed through extensive consultation and would be based on international standards and best practices in order to avoid undue impacts on innovation\",\"accordingly if an exhaustive understanding of each jurisdictions approach is sought other academic and legal resources should be consulted in conjunction with this reportwith these caveats in mind the target audience we foresee this analysis will be most valuable for includes policymakers who want to contextualise their approaches to regulatory policy in relation to other jurisdictions or understand existing options for specific governance challenges international and national bodies including standards organisations seeking to promote cooperation or convergence in governance between different jurisdictions multinational corporations and smes trying to understand and respect the different requirements that may apply to them in different jurisdictions prospective audit and certification bodies seeking to develop and provide bespoke ai auditing and certification services civil society organisations that seek a comparable high level understanding of regulatory policy in each jurisdiction researchers who want to understand relevant similarities and differences between governments approaches to ai regulatory policy\",\"finally with regards to federal legislation the usas approach is characterised by a patchwork of sectoral legislation see under regulatory requirements which are enforced by appointed competent authorities\",\"the july  policy paper highlighted several key challenges that cut across the regulatory landscape including a lack of clarity overlaps inconsistencies and gaps in the current approach\",\"over the past three years the ai governance landscape has become considerably more defined with several governments proposing regulatory policies for governing ai within their jurisdictions\",\"regulation this chapter discusses some of the current legal requirements and guidance that are considered by the supervisory authorities to be most relevant to mitigating the risks associated with ai\",\"new yorks ai audit law legislative documents which do not specifically relate to ai even if theyare used to enforce protections eg\",\"market surveillance authorities would also control the market and investigate compliance with the obligations and requirements for all high risk ai systems already placed on the market\",\"the supervisory authorities may therefore issue technology specific rules and guidance where appropriate\",\"since  policymakers globally have been increasingly focused on the development and implementation of initiatives and national strategies for the governance of artificial intelligence ai systems\",\"this report and our subsequent publications in this project will aid stakeholders in having this contextualised understanding of ai regulatory policy as ai regulatory policy continues to mature it is crucial that policymakers and other key stakeholders leverage this contextual understanding to promote regulatory cooperation coordination and where appropriate alignment\",\"to ensure uniform implementation across the union and economies of scale it is appropriate to establish common rules for the regulatory sandboxes implementation and a framework for cooperation between the relevant authorities involved in the supervision of the sandboxes\",\"at a high level similarities can be drawn between the eu and canada on the one hand who introduce horizontal hard law regulations for ai that are relatively centralised and the usa uk and china on the other who rely more on different types of decentralised regulatory policy\",\"an office headed by a new ai and data commissioner would be created as a centre of expertise in support of both regulatory development and administration of the act\",\"pioneer fund to help regulators promote cutting edge regulatory practices when developing emerging technologies\",\"the global interconnectedness of the digital economy requires that the regulation of ai systems in the marketplace be coordinated internationally\",\"ai regulatory sandboxes established by one or more member states competent authorities or the european data protection supervisor shall provide a controlled environment that facilitates the development testing and validation of innovative ai systems for a limited time before their placement on the market or putting into service pursuant to a specific plan\",\"the implementation rate of non binding instruments is difficult to predict and there is insufficient indication that thepersuasive effect of a recommendation would be strong enough to produce consistentadaptation of national laws\",\"as the rest of this guidance suggests the data protection implications of ai are heavily dependent on the specific use cases the population they are deployed on other overlapping regulatory requirements as well as social cultural and political considerations\",\"the usa uk and china have taken more decentralised approaches that rely on a patchwork of regulatory policies\",\"we then apply this framework to the regulatory approaches of five ai early movers in ai regulatory policy  canada china the european union eu the united kingdom uk and the united states of america usa  including a detailed comparative analysis of their approaches to risk regulatory requirements with deep dives into the role of technical standards impact assessments and audit and monitoring and enforcement\",\"canadian regulation of ai systems in the private sectorthe degree of regulation of private sector ai systems under the aida will depend in part on whether the system falls within the definition of a high impact system with such systems being subject to a higher degree of regulation\",\"in this report we develop an accessible comparative framework that captures the key similarities and differences in governments approaches to regulatory policy for governing ai\",\"like the initiatives proposed in the eu and canada these policies introduce specific prohibitions and legal requirements for ai see section\",\"beginning with our current regulatory framework we have considered how key existing sectoral legal requirements and guidance in uk financial services apply to ai\",\"the government of canada has been at the forefront of ai standards development both for its internal oversight of ai systems and to support external regulatory objectives\",\"we reviewed ai regulatory policy documents published on the oecds ai policy observatory and filtered them based on an inclusionexclusion criteria that can be found in appendix\",\"how to regulate ai to ensure it delivers in the best interests of consumers firms and markets is the subject of a wide ranging debate both here in the uk and in other jurisdictions around the world\",\"they also introduce a series of proportional obligations that vary depending on the person responsible for an ai system in each regulation\",\"there is broad international consensus on the key legal and regulatory challenges of ai safety including robustness of performance and cyber security transparency and explainability accountability human control bias mitigation and privacy protection see for example the european commissions ethics guidelines for trustworthy ai\",\"it is incumbent on framework users to continue to execute the govern function as knowledge cultures and needs or expectations from ai actors evolve over time\",\"to ensure a legal framework that is innovation friendly futureproof and resilient to disruption national competent authorities from one or more member states should be encouraged to establish artificial intelligence regulatory sandboxes to facilitate the development and testing of innovative ai systems under strict regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market or otherwise put into service\",\"understanding the similarities and differences between different governments approaches is an important first step for promoting deeper cooperation and improved interoperability of regulatory frameworks for ai technologies\",\"the government intends to build on this framework through an open and transparent regulatory development process\",\"to identify relevant regulatory policies for iterating our framework we undertook a systematised literature search that culminated in a corpus of relevant ai regulatory policy documents see appendix\",\"the general rules guidance and principles will be relevant to the firms use of ai\",\"that said the policy document highlights the importance of regulatory coordination for this approach to work to avoid contradictory approaches and help spot emerging issues\",\"for the development of high risk ai systems certain actors such as providers notified bodies and other relevant entities such as digital innovation hubs testing experimentation facilities and researchers should be able to access and use high quality datasets within their respective fields of activities which are related to this regulation\",\"at the same time ai researchers and innovators are concerned by the uncertainty that exists regarding future regulation\",\"most of the data in government available to train our models is within legacy systems which might contain bias and might have poor controls around it\",\"the cac chinas internet regulator has been most active in introducing hard regulatory measures related to different ai technologies\",\"below the level of cross cutting regulation sector specific regulators are working on frameworks for ai use\",\"if you intend to use ai to process special category data or data about criminal offences then you will need to ensure you comply with the requirements of articles  and  of the uk gdpr as well as the dpa\",\"regulatory requirements the eu and canada both take a horizontal hard law approach proposing a series of requirements that vary in stringency and type based on their respective classifications of ai systems in levels of risk eu and impact canada\",\"in contrast to the approaches taken by the eu and canada this will place the burden for designing regulatory policy for ai on several different regulators\",\"on top of this the approach proposes specific characteristics of ai and a set of cross sectoral principles that will guide sector led governance however like the usas bor the uk stresses that the interpretation of these principles should be context dependent\",\"a first step towards this ambition is clarifying how existing legal requirements and guidance apply to the use of ai\",\"the governance and regulation of ai is an emerging area which will evolve rapidly in the coming years\",\"while the usa is more likely to rely on existing not ai specific sectoral regulation china has developed overarching soft law ethical guidance for ai in general and hard law regulatory requirements targeted at specific types of ai technologies\",\"the common thread amongst this plethora of international initiatives is the aim to foster dialogue and advance common frameworks for ai governance\",\"for the supervisory authorities there may be a number of benefits to providing a more precise definition of ai in their respective rulebooks\",\"regulators pioneer fund to help regulators promote cuttingedge regulatory practices when developing emerging technologies\",\"this dp sits within the broader context of this global debate and focuses on a specific area  the regulation of ai within uk financial services\",\"in the past few years early mover governments have made significant progress in developing their approaches to ai regulatory policy\",\"part   sets out a separate regime for law enforcement authorities\",\"introduction as noted in the foreword there is a wide ranging debate about the regulation of ai\",\"we hope that our comparative framework can be used to analyse present and future regulatory ai approaches according to a common ground and in turn foster enhanced cooperation\",\"these initial categories were based on consultations with ai policy experts from ceimia and the project steering committee who outlined areas of ai regulatory policy that they considered important for our audience\",\"the uk government is planning to reform these laws including amending the right to human intervention in the data protection and digital information bill which is currently at the second reading stage in the house of commons\",\"moreover the uk governments proposed approach to regulating ai is underpinned by a set of cross sectoral principles tailored to the specific characteristics of aiensure that ai is used safelyensure that ai is technically secure and functions as designedmake sure that ai is appropriately transparent and explainableembed considerations of fairness into aidefine legal persons responsibility for ai governanceclarify routes to redress or contestabilitythe uk government stated that it will be considering the roles powers remits and capabilities of regulators the need for coordination and how this should be delivered across the range of regulators statutory and non statutory involved in ai regulation as part of its next steps\",\"more legal certainty on interaction with authorities platforms will have to cooperate with authorities that issue legal orders that have minimum common criteria\",\"for example government surveillance and data search and seizure are subject to legal requirements and judicial oversight\",\"in order to minimise the risks to implementation resulting from lack of knowledge and expertise in the market as well as to facilitate compliance of providers and notified bodies with their obligations under this regulation the ai on demand platform the european digital innovation hubs and the testing and experimentation facilities established by the commission and the member states at national or eu level should possibly contribute to the implementation of this regulation\",\"in addition sector specific laws cover situations where adapted approaches are necessary\",\"standards are of particular note for this report as they can be used to both demonstrate conformity with emerging ai regulation and promote interoperability among different jurisdictions\",\"in canada the main policies at the heart of its regulatory approach are the proposed artificial intelligence and data act aida and the already adopted directive on automated decision making\",\"chapter  sets out the legal requirements for high risk ai systems in relation to data and data governance documentation and recording keeping transparency and provision of information to users human oversight robustness accuracy and security\",\"in addition to legal requirements and guidance targeted at particular risks such as risks to consumers or effective competition the supervisory authorities have identified sets of cross cutting legal requirements and guidance that encompasses multiple areas of risk\",\"in particular a fragmented regulatory environment that lacks a high degree of mutual recognition could create barriers for interoperability and trade\",\"the uks approach which is most clearly laid out in the document establishing a pro innovation approach to regulating ai  proposes a sector led approach that relies on regulators to address the impacts of ai in their specific context\",\"this regulation shall not apply to public authorities in a third country nor to international organisations falling within the scope of this regulation pursuant to paragraph  where those authorities or organisations use ai systems in the framework of international agreements for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the union or with one or more member states\",\"since then looking to external oversight canada is playing a key role in the modernization of its regulatory system\",\"ai industry standards or codes of conduct may potentially complement the regulatory system by helping firms build trust amongst users that their systems meet widely accepted industry norms which may extend beyond the minimum requirements for regulatory compliance\",\"one of the central questions is whether the technology can be managed through extensions of existing regulatory frameworks or whether a new approach is needed\",\"chinas ministry of science and technology provides overarching direction for chinas monitoring and enforcement typically through guidance with the cyberspace administration of china cac introducing and enforcing hard law measures related to specific ai technologies and data protection\",\"standards can also potentially complement the regulatory system by helping firms build trust among users that their systems meet widely accepted standards which may go above satisfying minimum requirements for regulatory compliance\",\"this divergence has the potential to undermine fledgling international initiatives create a fragmented regulatory landscape and bring about challenges for regulatory interoperability\",\"it is important that the regulatory environment is proportionate and conducive to facilitating safe and responsible adoption of ai so as not to act as a barrier to beneficial innovation\",\"for examplewhere financial services firms use ai to process personal data firms may have regulatory obligations under the uk general data protection regulation uk gdpr and the data protection act\",\"the supervisory authorities note that certain third parties providing data and ai models could emerge as future potential ctps as a result of the increasing use of these data and models\",\"similarly other governments and regulators around the world are developing their thinking and approaches to ai\",\"the objectives of the regulatory sandboxes should be to foster ai innovation by establishing a controlled experimentation and testing environment in the development and pre marketing phase with a view to ensuring compliance of the innovative ai systems with this regulation and other relevant union and member states legislation to enhance legal certainty for innovators and the competent authorities oversight and understanding of the opportunities emerging risks and the impacts of ai use and to accelerate access to markets including by removing barriers for small and medium enterprises smes and start ups\",\"codifying the role of the commissioner would separate the functions from other activities within ised and allow the commissioner to build a centre of expertise in ai regulation\",\"the regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence and amending certain union legislative acts defines a new common framework of requirements applicable to ai systems which goes well beyond the framework provided by existing legislation\",\"we specifically chose this inclusive understanding of regulatory policy that encompasses soft law initiatives as many jurisdictions currently favour lighter touch approaches which a hard law focus would not capture\",\"member states shall undertake the following actionsprovide small scale providers and start ups with priority access to the ai regulatory sandboxes to the extent that they fulfil the eligibility conditionsorganise specific awareness raising activities about the application of this regulation tailored to the needs of the small scale providers and userswhere appropriate establish a dedicated channel for communication with small scale providers and user and other innovators to provide guidance and respond to queries about the implementation of this regulation\",\"gatekeeper related problems are currently not effectively addressed by member states or the eu in existing regulation\",\"generally the supervisory authorities adopt a technology neutral approach in their supervisory and regulatory approaches\",\"in the usa several regulatory policies address risks associated with the development and use of ai systems in both the public and private sector\",\"moreover the framework will envisage specific measures supporting innovation including regulatory sandboxes and specific measures supporting small scale users and providers of high risk ai systems to comply with the new rules\",\"for instance in march  a regulation on algorithmic recommendations came into force introducing a variety of requirements and prohibitions in relation to these technologies\",\"on products and services that will bring further clarity and simplify the enforcement of the new rules\",\"in those cases the supervisory authorities may issue guidance or use other policy tools to clarify how the existing rules and relevant regulatory expectations apply to those technologies\",\"while the supervisory authorities generally take a technology neutral approach to regulation see box  for more details they are aware that risks may relate to the use of specific technologies\",\"the potential for ai innovation to assist the supervisory authorities and regulatory activity depends significantly on access to data and technology so may have implications for the data that firms are required to share\",\"in addition this proposal complements other strands in the commissions ai policy based onpreventive regulatory and supervisory requirements aimed directly at avoiding fundamentalrights breaches such as discrimination\",\"this in turn leads to an increased effectiveness of enforcement and supervision measures whereas the current system relies to a large extent on the limited capability for supervision in a small number of member states\",\"canadas approach and consultation timelinecanada already possesses robust legal frameworks that apply to many of the uses of ai\",\"while the comparative framework is mostly based on the regulatory policy documents of the five jurisdictions analysed in this report we took two steps to ensure the robustness of the categories when adding other governments approaches later in this project\",\"it is important to acknowledge from the outset that the comparative framework developed in this report is a heuristic for understanding key similarities and differences between jurisdictions approaches to ai regulatory policy\",\"be lawand regulation agnostic\",\"importantly the uk is planning to publish a white paper which will provide further details on the countrys approach to ai regulatory policy\",\"this was aided by the diversity of the approaches taken by the early movers which necessitated a high degree of generality to ensure comparability second we cross referenced the comparative framework with a sample of regulatory policies from other jurisdictions to ensure its applicabilitywe use the same corpus of ai regulatory policies to inform the granular analysis of each governments approach in section four\",\"governments regulators and other authorities have published numerous documents on the subject\",\"on top of this the uks emphasis on proportionate and light touch regulatory policies means that there is also a significant role for self monitoring and enforcement within the uks approach\",\"these include  the difficulty to create a robust definition that would remain relevant in what is undoubtedly a rapidly developing field ii challenges of a definition that is too broad as this could cause regulation to lack specificity precision and proportionality iii potential for certain use cases products and services to fall outside of scope when they should not and iv creating the ability and incentives for firms to misclassify ai to reduce regulatory oversight\",\"chinas approach to ai regulatory policy is also not laid out in a single regulatory document with several government organisations publishing relevant documents\",\"regulation of ai under the aida is focused on organizations carrying out a regulated activity which means  processing or making available for use any data relating to human activities for the purpose of designing developing or using an ai system or  designing developing or making available for use an ai system or managing its operations\",\"the responses to this dp will help inform both the supervisory authorities thinking and any potential future policy proposals which will sit within the wider domestic and international context of emerging ai regulation\",\"in the uk much of the existing guidance has been focused on the public sector including public sector procurement compliance with equalities law and police use of facial recognition technology\",\"some jurisdictions intend to establish new monitoring bodies to enforce their respective ai regulations\",\"on the other hand it puts in place a proportionate regulatory system centred on a well defined risk based regulatory approach that does not create unnecessary restrictions to trade whereby legal intervention is tailored to those concrete situations where there is a justified cause for concern or where such concern can reasonably be anticipated in the near future\",\"the uk government aims to address these challenges by creating a framework for regulating ai that is context specific pro innovation and risk based coherent proportionate and adaptable\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"AI

also be an appropriate lawful basis for the use of an individuals data during deployment of an ai system eg for purposes such as personalising the service or making a prediction or

data in an ai context\",\"the possibility for the data to either be special category data anyway or becoming so during the processing ie if the processing involves analysing or inferring any data to do with health or genetic status\",\"in cases where data is provided to an entity eg health insurance company in order to facilitate payment for such a need that data should only be used for that purpose\",\"for example the training data may include a greater proportion of male borrowers because in the past fewer women applied for loans and therefore the bank doesnt have enough data about women\",\"however if the individual provides additional information that enables identification this is no longer the case and you need to fulfil any request they make\",\"for example if the way you intend to use peoples data would be unexpected or cause unnecessary harm\",\"is my personal information safe\",\"the project fits with how citizens and users expect their data to be used\",\"in cases where you implement an ai system from a third party any processing of personal data undertaken by the developer will have been for a different purpose eg to develop the system to what you intend to use the system for therefore you may need to identify a different lawful basis\",\"this therefore covers personal data contained in the training data\",\"consider if its ethical and safe to use the data refer to the data ethics framework\",\"in such cases it may be impossible or involve a disproportionate effort to provide information directly to the individual\",\"data collected based on these identified goals and for a specific context should not be used in a different context without assessing for new privacy risks and implementing appropriate mitigation measures which may include express consent\",\"any personal data contained in these models would be there by design and easily retrievable by the third party\",\"the more important it is that the personal data is accurate the greater the effort you should put into checking its accuracy and if necessary taking steps to rectify it\",\"it requires you to take all reasonable steps to make sure the personal data you process is not incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact and where necessary is corrected or deleted without undue delay\",\"uses personal data in ways which individuals would not reasonably expect\",\"in these cases if the training data is personal data access to the model by itself means that the organisation purchasing the model will already have access to a subset of the personal data contained in the training data without having to exert any further efforts\",\"it should be not left solely to individuals to carry the burden of reviewing and correcting data\",\"however unlike in model inversion they dont necessarily learn any additional personal data about the individual\",\"avoid inappropriate low quality or irrelevant data use and the compounded harm of its reuserelevant and high quality data\",\"it is important to note that local processing is not necessarily out of scope of data protection law\",\"the data use aligns with the data ethics framework\",\"in contrast anonymous information means that the information in question is no longer personal data and data protection law does not apply to it\",\"documented patterns show that personal data is being aggregated by data brokers to profile communities in harmful ways\",\"data collection should be minimized and clearly communicated to the people whose data is collected\",\"or the overall dataset may be unrepresentative\",\"however for consent to apply individuals must have a genuine choice about whether you can use their data\",\"so if you can achieve sufficient accuracy with fewer data points or fewer individuals being included or both you should do so\",\"the deployment of an ai system to process personal data needs to be driven by evidence that there is a problem and a reasoned argument that ai is a sensible solution to that problem not by the mere availability of the technology\",\"the right to data portability therefore applies in cases where this processing is based on consent or contract\",\"unchecked social media data collection has been used to threaten peoples opportunities undermine their privacy or pervasively track their activityoften without their knowledge or consent\",\"the data is still regarded as biometric data under the uk gdpr but is not special category data\",\"you may also be required to audit your ai systems to ensure they are compliant with various legislation including but not limited to data protection and this may involve processing of personal data\",\"moreover there is a risk that inaccurate and faulty data can be used to make decisions about their lives such as whether they will qualify for a loan or get a job\",\"for example the more things you want to do with the data the more difficult it is to ensure that consent is genuinely specific and informed\",\"use of anonymized data persons that carry out activities regulated by the act and who process or make available for use anonymized data in the course of the activity must in accordance with the regulations establish measures with respect to  the manner in which data is anonymized and  the usemanagement of anonymized data\",\"if you are procuring such a system you need to consider whether you can justify collecting so much personal data from candidates and if not request the provider modify their system or seek another provider\",\"you should note that in the majority of cases you are legally required to complete a dpia if you use ai systems that process personal data\",\"but if the model is trained on a vulnerable or sensitive population eg patients with dementia or hiv then merely revealing that someone is part of that population may be a serious privacy risk\",\"that information shall not contain personal data\",\"not collecting such data due to the risks doing so may pose to the other rights and freedoms of those individuals\",\"such processing could rely on legal obligation as a basis but this would only cover the auditing and testing of the system not any other use of that data\",\"the uk gdpr recognises that not all organisations involved in the processing will have the same degree of control or responsibility\",\"while a patchwork of laws exists to guide the collection and use of personal data in specific contexts including health employment education and credit it can be unclear how these laws apply in other contexts and in an increasingly automated society\",\"would another researcher be able to reproduce your results with the information available to them\",\"the purpose or purposes the data are to be used for\",\"finally the vast quantity of personal data you may hold and process as part of your ai systems is likely to put pressure on any pre existing non ai processes you use to identify and if necessary rectify delete inaccurate personal data whether it is used as input or training test data\",\"data subject rights can be specified in materials that are publicly available to data subjects such as privacy notices or participant information and organisations should have appropriate mechanisms to delete or withdraw data as required\",\"the right to rectification may apply to the use of personal data to train an ai system\",\"for the reasons stated above it may be difficult to identify and communicate with the individuals whose personal data is contained in the training data\",\"if youre unsure about your use of data consult the data ethics framework guidance to check your project is a safe application and deployment of ai models\",\"you must inform individuals if their personal data is going to be used to train an ai system to ensure that processing is fair and transparent\",\"where data collectors or automated systems seek consent they should seek it for specific narrow use contexts for specific time durations and for use by specific entities\",\"identifying the individuals that the training data is about is a potential challenge to ensuring their rights\",\"requests for rectification of model outputs or the personal data inputs on which they are based are therefore more likely to be made than requests for rectification of training data\",\"the impact of all this data harvesting is corrosive breeding distrust anxiety and other mental health problems chilling speech protest and worker organizing and threatening our democratic process\",\"businesses or public authorities that develop or use any ai applications not classified as high risk would only have minimal obligations of information\",\"the intention may not be presumed if the distortion of human behaviour results from factors external to the ai system which are outside of the control of the provider or the user\",\"in some cases you may not have obtained the training data from the individual and therefore not have had the opportunity to inform them at the time you did so\",\"establishing clear policies and good practices for the procurement and lawful processing of high quality training and test data is important especially if you do not have enough data internally\",\"where this data constitutes personal data it will generally be subject to all of the rights mentioned above unless exemptions or other limitations to those rights apply\",\"an organisation seeks to rely on legitimate interests for processing personal data for the purposes of training a machine learning model\",\"you should regularly and proactively evaluate the possibility of personal data being inferred from models in light of the state of the art technology so that you minimise the risk of accidental disclosure\",\"the personal data of the people who an ai system was trained on might be inadvertently revealed by the outputs of the system itself\",\"this may have implications depending on what you intend to do with the data  it can be difficult to ensure you collect valid consent for more complicated processing operations such as those involved in ai\",\"you should also document how you have considered the risks to the individuals that are having their personal data processed\",\"however generally speaking the more data points collected about each person and the more people whose data is included in the data set the greater the risks to those individuals even if the data is collected for a specific purpose\",\"depending on your circumstances you could base your processing of personal data for both development and ongoing use of ai on the legitimate interests lawful basis\",\"entities should allow to the extent legally permissible withdrawal of data access consent resulting in the deletion of user data metadata and the timely removal of their data from any systems eg machine learning models derived from that data\",\"even if the data lacks associated identifiers or contact details and has been transformed through pre processing training data may still be considered personal data\",\"the validity of this data pre processing and other design choices may only come into question as a result of an individuals challenge\",\"you should also note that when you are dealing with personal data that results from specific technical processing about the physical physiological or behavioural characteristics of an individual and allows or confirms that individuals unique identification that data is biometric data\",\"you are therefore unlikely to have a justification for not fulfilling the request to erase their personal data from your training dataset\",\"companies collect student data such as demographic information free or reduced lunch status whether theyve used drugs or whether theyve expressed interest in lgbtqi groups and then use that data to forecast student successparents and education experts have expressed concern about collection of such sensitive data without express parental consent the lack of transparency in how such data is being used and the potential for resulting discriminatory impacts\",\"in addition to being used in the inputs and outputs of a model in some cases personal data might also be contained in a model itself\",\"however in data protection law this is not necessarily considered sufficient to take that data out of scope\",\"similarly because civil partnerships were until recently only available to same sex couples data that indicates someone is in a civil partnership may indirectly reveal their sexual orientation\",\"you should however note that if your ai system processes personal data you always have to comply with the fundamental data protection principles and cannot trade this requirement away\",\"model inversion and membership inferences show that ai models can inadvertently contain personal data\",\"the aida does not define anonymized data\",\"however you should note that pseudonymisation is essentially a security and risk reduction technique and data protection law still applies to personal data that has undergone pseudonymisation\",\"you must not collect personal data on the off chance that it might be useful in the future although you may be able to hold information for a foreseeable event that may not occur but only if you are able to justify it\",\"where possible however you should apply them before collecting any personal data as a part of mitigating the risks to individuals that large datasets can pose\",\"are there any constraints on the data for example does it contain sensitive information such as home addresses\",\"consent withdrawal and data deletion\",\"if you are using ai to process personal data you therefore need to identify and assess these interests as part of your broader consideration of the risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals and how you will meet your obligations under the law\",\"when assessing if ai could help you meet users needs consider if theres data containing the information you need even if disguised or buried\",\"however you should not regard requests about such data as manifestly unfounded or excessive just because they may be harder to fulfil in the context of ai or the motivation for requesting them may be unclear in comparison to other access requests you might typically receive\",\"similarly ai systems that stop content being published based on the analysis of the creators personal data could impact their freedom of expression\",\"using ai to process any personal data has important implications for your security risk profile and you need to assess and manage these carefully\",\"dpias offer you an opportunity to consider how and why you are using ai systems to process personal data and what the potential risks could be\",\"the way ai systems are developed and deployed means that personal data is often managed and processed in unusual ways\",\"the data minimisation principle does not mean either process no personal data or if we process more were going to break the law\",\"a number of techniques exist which can help you to minimise the amount of personal data you need to process\",\"for example ai models trained on historical data may not account for a breakthrough healthcare treatment which can lead to mispriced policies\",\"typically training data only includes information relevant to predictions such as past transactions demographics or location but not contact details or unique customer identifiers\",\"people whose data is collected used shared or stored by automated systems should be able to access data and metadata about themselves know who has access to this data and be able to correct it if necessary\",\"therefore the chances that one of the relevant individuals makes a request are very small but remains possible\",\"in this context individual inaccuracies in training data may be less important as they are not likely to affect the performance of the model since they are just one data point among many when compared to personal data that you might use to take action about an individual\",\"as in the training phase there are a number of techniques which you can use to minimise personal data or mitigate risks posed to that data at the inference stage including converting personal data into less human readable formats\",\"consideration should be given to the level of control data subjects should have over their own data balancing the risks to individual privacy against the statistical value of the dataset\",\"you should note that whilst the right to erasure is not absolute you still need to consider any erasure request you receive unless you are processing the data on the basis of a legal obligation or public task both of which are unlikely to be lawful bases for training ai systems\",\"you should ensure any factors that may result in inaccuracies in personal data are corrected and the risk of errors is minimised\",\"you are also required to keep a record of all decisions made by an ai system as part of your accountability and documentation obligations\",\"thirdly you need to be transparent about how you process personal data in an ai system to comply with the principle of transparency\",\"to avoid such personal data being misinterpreted as factual you should ensure that your records indicate that they are statistically informed guesses rather than facts\",\"the key is that you only process the personal data you need for your purpose\",\"although data protection does not dictate how ai designers should do their jobs if you use ai to process personal data you need to comply with the principles of data protection by design and by default\",\"data should only be collected or used for the purposes of training or testing machine learning models if such collection and use is legal and consistent with the expectations of the people whose data is collected\",\"that persons review should also include an assessment of all relevant data including any information an individual may provide\",\"data quality sourcing and assurance poor quality or inappropriate data can potentially compromise any process that relies upon those data\",\"they should give the auditor access to all relevant data necessary to perform the audit properly\",\"if the data was initially processed for a different purpose and you later decide to use it for the separate purpose of training an ai system you need to inform the individuals concerned as well as ensuring the new purpose is compatible with the previous one\",\"in many contexts the answers the ai system provides will be personal data\",\"the key is that individuals understand how you are using their personal data and have consented to this use\",\"an insurer might collect data from a persons social media presence as part of deciding what life insurance rates they should be offered\",\"if your problem involves supporting an ongoing business decision process you will need to plan to establish ongoing up to date access to data\",\"our guidance says that if you make any of the following overarching decisions you will be a controller to collect personal data in the first place\",\"is the ability to perform repetitive tasks with data without the need for constant human guidance\",\"however if your assessment indicates a high risk to the data protection rights of individuals that you are unable to sufficiently reduce you are required to consult the ico before you can go ahead with the processing\",\"if an ai system can perform well enough without being trained on the individuals personal data performance of the contract does not depend on such processing\",\"access to such data should be limited based on necessity and based on a principle of local control such that those individuals closest to the data subject have more access while those who are less proximate do not eg a teacher has access to their students daily progress data while a superintendent does not\",\"is the data secure and do you have permission to use it\",\"relevance of data should not be established solely by appealing to its historical connection to the outcome\",\"organizations that carry out any regulated activity and process or make available for use anonymized data must establish measures with respect to the manner in which data is anonymized and the use or management of anonymized data\",\"your dpia needs to describe the nature scope context and purposes of any processing of personal data\",\"if you exercise overall control of the purpose and means of the processing of personal data  you decide what data to process and why  you are a controller\",\"in some cases this ethical review may determine that data should not be used or shared for specific uses even with consent\",\"if the personal data is not inaccurate then the right to rectification does not apply\",\"similarly if personal data on the users device is subsequently accessed by a third party this activity would constitute processing of that data\",\"unless the individual presents evidence that their personal data could be inferred from the model you may not be able to determine whether personal data can be inferred and therefore whether the request has any basis\",\"will anyone be identifiable from the data or the research outcomes\",\"to the extent that synthetic data cannot be related to identified or identifiable living individuals it is not personal data and therefore data protection obligations do not apply when you process it\",\"whether you can provide your service without this processing ie if the personalisation of content by means of an ai system is not integral to the service you should consider an alternative lawful basis\",\"if there is a less intrusive way of processing their data to provide the same service or if the processing is not in practice objectively necessary for the performance of the contract then you cannot rely on this lawful basis for the processing of data with ai\",\"it may also impact on your compliance with the data minimisation principle as personal data which includes inferences must be adequate and relevant for your purpose\",\"although you must carry out your dpia before the processing of personal data begins you should also consider it to be a live document\",\"either in terms of a further erosion of privacy if human reviewers need to consider additional personal data in order to validate or reject an ai generated output or the possible reintroduction of human biases at the end of an automated process\",\"many employers transfer employee data to third party job verification services\",\"new data sources such as social media data and biometric data are increasingly being used by analysts to identify social trends and using these sources raises ethical questions surrounding confidentiality\",\"however the fact that it is no longer easily human interpretable does not imply that the converted data is no longer personal\",\"in cases where confidence information provided by a ml system can be exploited as in the frt example above the risk could be mitigated by not providing it to the end user\",\"in these cases the credit score is not included within scope of the right to data portability even if other features are\",\"the privacy of this data and use of this data in a responsible manner is also important\",\"might your data system or results be re used outside of their original context and purpose in the future to the disadvantage of individuals groups or communities\",\"you should assess whether the training data contains identified or identifiable personal data of individuals either directly or by those who may have access to the model\",\"ultimately it is necessary for you to assess the risks to individual rights that your use of ai poses\",\"similarly even if you can use performance of a contract as a lawful basis to provide a quote prior to a contract this does not mean you can also use it to justify using that data to develop the ai system\",\"the erasure of one individuals personal data from the training data is unlikely to affect your ability to fulfil the purposes of training an ai system as you are likely to still have sufficient data from other individuals\",\"unlike model inversion and membership inference personal data contained in models like this is not an attack vector\",\"meanwhile members of the american public are often unable to access their personal data or make critical decisions about its collection and use\",\"data brokers frequently collect consumer data from numerous sources without consumers permission or knowledge\",\"it is normally assumed that the personal data of the individuals whose data was used to train an ai system cannot be inferred by simply observing the predictions the system returns in response to new inputs\",\"you may already process personal data in the context of creating statistical models and using those models to make predictions about people\",\"the nature scope context and purposes of the processing of personal data by the ai system and the risks posed to individuals as a result\",\"you can apply these types of privacy enhancing techniques to the training data after you have already collected it\",\"depending on your context you may also have other sector specific regulatory obligations regarding statistical accuracy or discrimination which you will need to be consider alongside your data protection obligations\",\"this could include knowingly using personal information obtained from a data breach to train an ai system\",\"infer additional context if the information is not present in the data\",\"however where this is personal data you need to consider whether it is necessary to process it for your purposes\",\"in addition to these considerations about training data and individual rights in general below we outline some considerations about how particular individual rights rectification erasure portability and information may relate to training data\",\"so if you use biometric data for testing and mitigating discrimination in your ai system but not for the purpose of confirming the identity of the individuals within the dataset or making any kind of decision in relation to them the biometric data does not come under article\",\"this would not reveal any individuals data from the training data set itself but in practice it would reveal that they had visited one of the hospitals that generated the training data during the period the data was collected\",\"when you use ai to process personal data you must ensure that it is lawful fair and transparent\",\"when personal data is included in models by design it is because certain types of models such as support vector machines svms contain some key examples from the training data in order to help distinguish between new examples during deployment\",\"if you can achieve the same outcome by processing less personal data then by definition the data minimisation principle requires you to do so\",\"there are some examples in which the use of an ai system to process personal data may be a legal obligation\",\"under data protection law individuals have a number of rights relating to their personal data\",\"the eu database shall contain personal data only insofar as necessary for collecting and processing information in accordance with this regulation\",\"also as discussed in the icos previous report on ai and big data the fact that some data might later in the process be found to be useful for making predictions is not enough to establish why you need to keep it for this purpose nor does it retroactively justify its collection use or retention\",\"patients were not aware that the data would be used in this way or monitored by anyone other than their doctor\",\"to avoid this your records should indicate where ai outputs are not intended to reflect objective facts and any decisions taken on the basis of such personal data should reflect these limitations\",\"providers of such ml models and any third parties procuring them should be aware that they may contain personal data in this way\",\"however the original form of the data from which the pre processed data was derived is still subject to the right to data portability if provided by the individual under consent or contract and processed by automated means\",\"it is not possible to list all known security risks that might be exacerbated when you use ai to process personal data\",\"this means that if you deploy an ai model you may not need to process the human interpretable version of the personal data contained in the query\",\"in this case the data is not subject to data portability although it does still constitute personal data and as such other data protection rights still apply eg the right of access\",\"for example they might interact directly with the person the decision is about to gather such information\",\"to manage the risks to individuals that arise from processing personal data in your ai systems it is important that you develop a mature understanding of fundamental rights risks and how to balance these and other interests\",\"similarly if you use ai as part of the exercise of your official authority or to perform a task in the public interest set out by law the necessary processing of personal data involved may be based on those grounds\",\"if you outsource an ai service to another organisation this could also make the process of responding to rights requests more complicated when the personal data involved is processed by them rather than you\",\"personal data resulting from further analysis of provided data is not subject to the right to portability\",\"individuals have the right to data portability for data they have provided to a controller where the lawful basis of processing is consent or contract\",\"is the ability to perform repetitive tasks with data without the need for constant human guidance\",\"for example training data may have been stripped of any personal identifiers and contact addresses while still remaining personal data\",\"another way to minimise the personal data involved in prediction is to host the ml model on the device from which the query is generated and which already collects and stores the individuals personal data\",\"in such circumstances in order to balance interests between theinjured person and the non professional user it needs to be taken into account whethersuch non professional users can add to the risk of an ai system causing damagethrough their behaviour\",\"this applies to the use of ai just as to other technologies that process personal data\",\"similarly if the personal data does not allow or confirm an individuals unique identification then it is not biometric data or special category data\",\"this section sets out some of the things you should think about when carrying out a dpia for the processing of personal data in ai systems\",\"this is because in most cases collection of personal data about the use of a service details of how users engage with that service or for the development of new functions within that service are not objectively necessary for the provision of a contract\",\"the more noise you inject the less you can learn from the data but in some cases you may be able to inject sufficient noise to render the data pseudonymous in a way which provides a meaningful level of protection\",\"in most cases data used for training a model eg demographic information or spending habits counts as data provided by the individual\",\"the personal information protection law requires an ex ante data protection impact assessment if personal information is handled or used for automated decision making\",\"where that real data can be related to identified or identifiable individuals then the processing of such data must comply with data protection laws\",\"if it is unclear whether or not your system may be inferring such data you may want to identify a condition to cover that possibility and reduce your compliance risk although this is not a legal requirement\",\"there are specific provisions in data protection law covering individuals rights where processing involves solely automated individual decision making including profiling with legal or similarly significant effects\",\"ensuring the exclusion of unnecessary data will help prevent the system from identifying unhelpful correlations\",\"do you understand the onward effects of using data in this way\",\"have you considered whether it is appropriate to anonymise your data and if so what the most appropriate methods of anonymisation will be\",\"we recognise that the use of personal data with ai may sometimes make it harder to fulfil individual rights to information access rectification erasure restriction of processing and notification\",\"special category data is defined as personal data that reveals or concerns the special categories\",\"because these processes involve converting personal data from one form into another potentially less detailed form they may make training data potentially much harder to link to a particular named individual\",\"even if the personal data involved in training is being processed on the users device the organisation which creates and distributes the model is still a controller in so far as it determines the means and purposes of processing\",\"within ai these rights apply wherever personal data is used at any of the various points in the development and deployment lifecycle of an ai system\",\"for example the mere possibility that some data might be useful for a prediction is not by itself sufficient for the organisation to demonstrate that processing this data is necessary for building the model\",\"provided data includes data the individual has consciously input into a form but also behavioural or observational data gathered in the process of using a service\",\"for example you may need to remove certain features from the data or apply privacy enhancing technologies pets before sharing it with another organisation\",\"data protections accuracy principle applies to all personal data whether it is information about an individual used as an input to an ai system or an output of the system\",\"this is because it can be used to single out the individual it relates to on its own or in combination with other data you may process even if it cannot be associated with a customers name\",\"furthermore even if it is an appropriate ground for the use of the system this may not be an appropriate ground for processing personal data to develop an ai system\",\"this is problematic for businesses in direct competition with a gatekeeper who can use such data to its own interest\",\"for example if the data was initially collected on the basis of consent even if the new purpose is compatible you still need to collect a fresh consent for the new purpose\",\"raw personal data will usually first have to be converted into a more abstract format for the purposes of prediction\",\"consent should not extend if any of these conditions change consent should be re acquired before using data if the use case changes a time limit elapses or data is transferred to another entity including being shared or sold\",\"you should consult our guidance on determining what is personal data for more information about identifiability\",\"data use is not compliant with legislation guidance or the government organisations public narrative\",\"however unlike human recruiters you cannot hold an ai system directly responsible or accountable for denying applicants a job\",\"however unlike human recruiters you cannot hold an ai system directly responsible or accountable for denying applicants a job\",\"if human reviewers can only access or use the same data used by the ai system then arguably they are not taking into account other additional factors\",\"processing of personal data for the purposes of training a model may not directly affect the individuals but once the model is deployed it may automatically make decisions which have legal or significant effects\",\"your ai system therefore needs to be sufficiently statistically accurate to ensure that any personal data generated by it is processed lawfully and fairly\",\"consent should only be used to justify collection of data in cases where it can be appropriately and meaningfully given\",\"that information shall not include personal data\",\"often several different organisations will be involved in developing and deploying ai systems which process personal data\",\"in some cases some or all of the features used to train the model may themselves be the result of some previous analysis of personal data\",\"accordingly such data should be subject to extra oversight to ensure safety and efficacy\",\"first processing of personal data must be fair\",\"this may make it harder to understand when and how individual rights apply to this data and more challenging to implement effective mechanisms for individuals to exercise those rights\",\"ai systems used to monitor the performance and behaviour of these persons may also impact their rights to data protection and privacy\",\"what will happen with the data collected and how will it be used going forward\",\"you should also note that you are unlikely to be able to rely on this basis for processing personal data for purposes such as service improvement of your ai system\",\"security of personal data may not always have been a key priority especially if someone was previously building ai applications with non personal data or in a research capacity\",\"there may be times where you are not able to identify an individual in the training data directly or indirectly\",\"this regulation should not be understood as providing for the legal ground for processing of personal data including special categories of personal data where relevant\",\"for example the default approach of data scientists in designing and building ai systems might involve collecting and using as much data as possible without thinking about ways they could achieve the same purposes with less data\",\"under the privacy act federal agencies may only retain data about an individual that is relevant and necessary to accomplish an agencys statutory purpose or to comply with an executive order of the president\",\"the use of personal data in the development and deployment of ai systems may not just pose risks to individuals information rights\",\"potential mitigationsonce the dataset has been explored and the data necessary for the research has been determined additional data should be deleted\",\"so even if an adversarial attack does not involve personal data it may still be a nis incident and therefore within the icos remit\",\"consent may be an appropriate lawful basis in cases where you have a direct relationship with the individuals whose data you want to process\",\"the project fits with how citizens users expect their data to be used\",\"by contrast under the aida  a person who carries out a regulated activity and who processes or makes available for use anonymized data in the course of that activity will be required to establish measures with respect to  the manner in which data is anonymized and  the use or management of anonymized data\",\"you therefore still need to consider this data when you are responding to individuals requests to exercise their rights\",\"in a limited number of cases the processing of personal data by an ai system might be based on protecting the vital interests of the individuals\",\"whenever you are processing personal data  whether to train a new ai system or make predictions using an existing one  you must have an appropriate lawful basis to do so\",\"this requires among other things that the provider does not modify the information that it transmits\",\"if the model is used to make predictions or classifications about individual people then it is very likely that personal data will be used at both the training and inference phases\",\"conversely use of ai to process personal data for purposes of personalising content may be regarded as necessary for the performance of a contract  but only in some cases\",\"to enable this where you are using models which contain personal data by design you should implement them in a way that allows the easy retrieval of these examples\",\"the law allows for individuals to be able to access any of their individual information stored in a federal system of records if not included under one of the systems of records exempted pursuant to the privacy act\",\"what types of personal data to collect\",\"therefore you need to review your data governance practices and systems to ensure they remain fit for purpose\",\"the model fits with the government organisations policy on data use\",\"you may also receive requests for the erasure of personal data contained within training data\",\"in any case if you have a major project that involves the use of personal data it is also good practice to do a dpia\",\"depending on the technological use case and based on an ethical assessment consent for sensitive data may need to be acquired from a guardian andor child\",\"however these are not yet standard practices and the united states lacks a comprehensive statutory or regulatory framework governing the

shall take out appropriate liability insurance for their conformity assessment activities unless liability is assumed by the member state concerned in accordance with national law or that member state is directly responsible for the conformity assessment\",\"similarly thisdirective does not harmonise the conditions related to the damage for instance whatdamages are compensable which are also regulated by applicable national and unionlaw\",\"this condition is justified by the need to balance the interests of injuredpersons and non professional users by exempting from the application of the presumption ofcausality the cases in which non professional users do not add risk through their behaviour\",\"therefore a targeted rebuttable presumption ofcausality has been laid down in article   regarding this causal link\",\"thispossibility can incentivise defendants to comply with their disclosure obligations withmeasures set by the ai act to ensure a high level of transparency of the ai or withdocumenting and recording requirements\",\"victims may therefore bedeterred from claiming compensation altogether\",\"the defendant should be able to rebutthat presumption by submitting evidence to the contrary\",\"in addition depending on each member states civil lawsystem and traditions victims will be able to claim compensation for damage to other legalinterests such as violations of

causation since it is required to explain how theai system was led by the human act or omission that constitutes fault to produce theoutput or the failure to produce an output which gave rise to the damage\",\"we recommend discussing this with legal advisors\",\"in thecase of claims based on article  the defendants compliance with the obligations listed inthat paragraph have to be assessed also

well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence could be hampered in particular where such ai systems are not sufficiently transparent explainable and documented\",\"the application of the presumption of causality is meant to ensure for the injuredperson a similar level of protection as for situations where ai is not involved andwhere causality may therefore be easier to prove\",\"for example if a firm obstructs attempts to verify whether they have complied with their obligations or provides false or misleading information they could be subject to prosecution\",\"access to information about specific high risk ai systems that are suspected of havingcaused damage is an important factor to ascertain whether to claim compensation andto substantiate claims for compensation\",\"given that in practice it may be difficult for theclaimant to prove such non compliance when the defendant is a provider of the aisystem and in full consistency with the logic of the ai act this directive shouldalso provide that the steps undertaken by the provider within the risk managementsystem and the results of the risk management system ie\",\"the proposal for this directive has been adopted together with the proposal for a revision ofthe product liability directive eec in a package aiming to adapt liability rules to thedigital age and ai ensuring the necessary alignment between these two complementary legalinstruments\",\"choice of instrumenta directive is the most suitable instrument for this proposal as it provides the desiredharmonisation

a claim for damages\",\"the preparatorywork started in  with the setting up of the expert group on liability and newtechnologies new technologies formation\",\"in this respect article  of the directive provides that a court may order the disclosure ofrelevant evidence about specific high risk ai systems that are suspected of having causeddamage\",\"moreoverfrom the various tools available in national law for easing the burden of proof this proposalhas chosen to use rebuttable presumptions as the least interventionist tool\",\"the fault of the defendant has to be proven by the claimant according to the applicable unionor national rules\",\"at the same time such means serve to exclude falsely identified potentialdefendants saving time and costs for the parties involved and reducing the case load forcourts\",\"this proposal covers national liability claims mainly based on the fault of anyperson with a view of compensating any type of damage and any type of victim\",\"similarly risks such as concept drift and lack of explainability in claims management ai systems could impact policyholders ability to claim and their overall protection\",\"this provision aims to give more possibilities to persons injured by an ai system to havetheir claims assessed by a court even in cases where individual actions may seem too costlyor too cumbersome to bring or where joint actions may entail a benefit of scale\",\"a provider should be able to benefit from the exemptions from liability for mere conduit and for caching services when it is in no way involved with the information transmitted\",\"ai harms for example vary by context where they might be already addressed by particular sectoral laws\",\"subject to the requirements laid down in this article national courts shall presumefor the purposes of applying liability rules to a claim for damages the causal linkbetween the fault of the defendant and the output produced by the ai system or thefailure of the ai system to produce an output where all of the following conditionsare met the claimant has demonstrated or the court has presumed pursuant to article the fault of the defendant or of a person for whose behaviour the defendant isresponsible consisting in the non compliance with a duty of care laid down in unionor national law directly intended to protect against the damage that occurred it can be considered reasonably likely based on the circumstances of the case thatthe fault has influenced the output produced by the ai system or the failure of the aisystem to produce an output the claimant has demonstrated that the output produced by the ai system or thefailure of the ai system to produce an output gave rise to the damage\",\"all national liability regimes have dutiesof care taking as a standard of conduct different expressions of the principle how areasonable person should act which also ensure the safe operation of ai systems inorder to prevent damage to recognised legal interests\",\"in fixing the amount of the fine the commission shall have regard to the nature gravity duration and recurrence of the infringement and for fines imposed pursuant to paragraph  the delay caused to the proceedings\",\"non compliance with duties of care that were not directly intended toprotect against the damage that occurred do not lead to the application of thepresumption for example a providers failure to file required documentation withcompetent authorities would not lead to the application of the presumption in claimsfor damages due to physical injury\",\"verification costs could amount to another eur   to eur   for suppliers of high risk ai\",\"in such instances the liability rules of this proposalwill apply\",\"this effect is even more unlikely for measures concerning private law of which noncontractual liability rules form part\",\"in the case of non high risk ai systems article  establishes a condition for theapplicability of the presumption of causality whereby the latter is subject to the courtdetermining that it is excessively difficult for the claimant to prove the causal link\",\"such an approachallows claimants in cases of damage caused by ai systems to invoke more favourablerules of national law\",\"those services too can benefit from the exemptions from liability to the extent that they qualify as mere conduit caching or hosting service\",\"thus national laws could for example maintain reversals of theburden of proof under national fault based regimes or national no fault liabilityreferred to as strict liability regimes of which there are already a large variety innational laws possibly applying to damage caused by ai systems\",\"in the case of a claim for damages concerning a high risk ai system a national courtshall not apply the presumption laid down in paragraph  where the defendantdemonstrates that sufficient evidence and expertise is reasonably accessible for theclaimant to prove the causal link mentioned in paragraph\",\"where a defendant fails to comply with an order by a national court in a claim fordamages to disclose or to preserve evidence at its disposal pursuant to paragraphs or  a national court shall presume the defendants non compliance with a relevantduty of care in particular in the circumstances referred to in article  or  thatthe evidence requested was intended to prove for the purposes of the relevant claimfor damages\",\"given the large divergence between member statesexisting civil liability rules it is likely that any national ai specific measure on liabilitywould follow existing different national approaches and therefore increase fragmentation\",\"the choice of suitable legal tools is limited given the nature of the burden of proof issue andthe specific characteristics of ai that pose a problem for existing liability rules\",\"subject matter and scope article the purpose of this directive is to improve the functioning of the internal market by layingdown uniform requirements for certain aspects of non contractual civil liability for damagecaused with the involvement of ai systems\",\"member states may adopt or maintain national rules that are more favourable forclaimants to substantiate a non contractual civil law claim for damages caused by anai system provided such rules are compatible with union law\",\"national ai strategies show that several member states are considering or even concretelyplanning legislative action on civil liability for ai\",\"there could be situations where the evidence relevant for the case is heldby entities that would not be parties to the claim for damages but which are under anobligation to document or record such evidence pursuant to the ai act\",\"such fault can be established for example for non compliance with a dutyof care pursuant to the ai act or pursuant to other rules set at union level such as thoseregulating the use of automated monitoring and decision making for platform work or thoseregulating the operation of unmanned aircraft\",\"in this respect disclosure should only concern evidencethat is necessary for a decision on the respective claim for damages for example onlythe parts of the relevant records or data sets required to prove non compliance with arequirement laid down by the ai act\",\"paragraphs  and  differentiate between on the one hand claims brought against theprovider of a high risk ai system or against a person subject to the providers obligationsunder the ai act and on the other hand claims brought against the user of such systems\",\"according to article  the claimant can request the disclosure of evidence from providersor users that are not defendants only in case all proportionate attempts were unsuccessfullymade to gather the evidence from the defendant\",\"this directive does not apply to criminal liability\",\"if a victim brings a claim national courts faced with the specific characteristics of ai mayadapt the way in which they apply existing rules on an ad hoc basis to come to a just result forthe victim\",\"users will have access to dispute resolution mechanisms in their own country\",\"disclosure of evidence article this directive aims to provide persons seeking compensation for damage caused by high riskai systems with effective means to identify potentially liable persons and relevant evidencefor a claim\",\"the latter shall remain fully responsible if the information supplied is incomplete incorrect or misleading\",\"when an injured person seeks compensation for damage suffered member statesgeneral fault based liability rules usually

defined by the ai act article  establishes an exceptionfrom the presumption of causality where the defendant demonstrates that sufficient evidenceand expertise is reasonably accessible for the claimant to prove the causal link\",\"if the provider of an ai system has complied with all itsobligations and in consequence that system was deemed sufficiently safe to be put onthe market for a given use by non professional users and it is then used for that task apresumption of causality should not apply for the simple launch of the operation ofsuch a system by such non professional users\",\"in cases where the defendant uses the ai system in the course of a personal non professionalactivity article  provides that the presumption of causality should only apply if thedefendant has materially interfered with the conditions of the operation of the ai system or ifthe defendant was required and able to determine the conditions of operation of the ai systemand failed to do so\",\"therefore adaptations of liability rules taken on a purely national basis would increase thebarriers to the rollout of ai enabled products and services across the internal market andcontribute further to fragmentation\",\"such adaptations should also maintain trust in the judicial system by ensuring thatvictims of damage caused with the involvement of ai have the same effectivecompensation as victims of damage caused by other technologies\",\"title v contributes to the objective to create a legal framework that is innovation friendly future proof and resilient to disruption\",\"under such rules victimsneed to prove a wrongful action or omission by a person who caused the damage\",\"however if a national court determines that a non professional user materially interfered with the conditions of operation of an aisystem or was required and able to determine the conditions of operation of the aisystem and failed to do so then the presumption of causality should apply where allthe other conditions are fulfilled\",\"due to the seriousness of the process guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and a firm could defend itself by demonstrating that it had shown due care in complying with its obligations\",\"for the presumption of causality under this directive to apply the fault of thedefendant should be established as a human act or omission which does not meet aduty of care under union law or national law that is directly intended to protect againstthe damage that occurred\",\"in this respectthis directive eases the burden of proof in a very targeted and proportionate manner throughthe use of disclosure and rebuttable presumptions\",\"this added value would be generated notably through reducedfragmentation and increased legal certainty regarding stakeholders liability exposure\",\"the second stage included in the proposal ensures that when assessing the effect of the firststage in terms of victim protection and uptake of ai future technological regulatory andjurisprudential developments will be taken into account when re assessing the need toharmonise other elements of the claims for compensation or other tools related to liabilityclaims including for situations where strict liability would be more appropriate as requestedby the european parliament\",\"hence for thepurposes of claims for damages in which a presumption of causality according to thisdirective is applied the potential fault of providers or persons subject to theobligations of a provider pursuant to the ai act is established only through a non compliance with such requirements\",\"in addition this directive should only cover claims for damages when the damage iscaused by an output or the failure to produce an output by an ai system through thefault of a person for example the provider or the user under the ai act\",\"in determining whether an order for the disclosure or preservation of evidence isproportionate national courts shall consider the legitimate interests of all partiesincluding third parties concerned in particular in relation to the protection of tradesecrets within the meaning of article  of directive eu  and

more difficult\",\"it should also be necessary to establish that it canbe considered reasonably likely based on the circumstances of the case that the faulthas influenced the output produced by the ai system or the failure of the ai system toproduce an output\",\"member states shall ensure that national courts are empowered either upon therequest of a potential claimant who has previously asked a provider a person subjectto the obligations of a provider pursuant to article  or article  of the ai actor a user to disclose relevant evidence at its disposal about a specific high risk aisystem that is suspected of having caused damage but was refused or a claimant toorder the disclosure of such evidence from those persons\",\"it is thereforeappropriate to lay down rules on the disclosure of

actual or potential harm caused by the infringement or suspected infringement\",\"fundamental rightsone of the most important functions of civil liability rules is to ensure that victims of damagecan claim compensation\",\"theycomplement one another to form an overall effective civil liability system\",\"moreover for high risk ai systems the aiact provides for specific documentation information and logging requirements butdoes not provide a right to the injured person to access that information\",\"while this directive does not apply with respect to criminal liability it may be applicablewith respect to state liability\",\"this directive covers the fault constituting non compliance with certain listedrequirements laid down in chapters  and  of the ai act for providers and

control mechanisms along with conventional system security protocols\",\"data privacy security and retention data security is important in ensuring information is protected from malicious threats such as unauthorised access theft and corruption\",\"sensitive data should only be used for functions strictly necessary for that domain or for functions that are required for administrative reasons eg school attendance records unless consent is acquired if appropriate and the additional expectations in this section are met\",\"these protections should be instituted throughout the design development and deployment process and are described below roughly in the order in which they would be instituted\",\"the principle of data minimisation requires you not to use more data than is necessary for your purposes\",\"accuracy in data protection is one of the fundamental principles requiring you to ensure that personal data is accurate and where necessary kept up to date\",\"transparency has transparency in the collection use retention and sharing of the data being used and produced been considered\",\"in addition to the privacy expectations above for general non sensitive data any system collecting using sharing or storing sensitive data should meet the expectations below\",\"there can be a wide range of interests that constitute legitimate interests in data protection law\",\"it should give you enough flexibility to develop ai systems which conform to data protection law in your own way taking a proportionate and risk based approach\",\"this section is aimed at senior management and those in compliance focused roles including data protection officers dpos who are accountable for the governance and data protection risk management of an ai system\",\"many states have also enacted consumer data privacy protection regimes to address some of these harms\",\"you can use a dpia to document the safeguards you put in place to ensure the individuals responsible for the development testing validation deployment and monitoring of ai systems are adequately trained and have an understanding of the data protection implications of the processing\",\"however depending on your context some of these approaches may be appropriate technical measures to ensure personal data processing is fair and to minimise the risks of discrimination arising from it\",\"part three covers the principles of security and data minimisation in ai systems\",\"make sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfil their data protection obligations\",\"has data minimisation been appropriately considered\",\"in addition data protection requires you to implement suitable safeguards when processing personal data to make solely automated decisions that have a legal or similarly significant impact on individuals\",\"you should be protected from violations of privacy through design choices that ensure such protections are included by default including ensuring that data collection conforms to reasonable expectations and that only data strictly necessary for the specific context is collected\",\"organisational and legacy issues make total data integration a significant challenge\",\"recital  of the uk gdpr says producers of ai solutions should be encouraged to take into account the right to data protection when developing and designing their systems\",\"a number of techniques exist which help both data minimisation and effective ai development and deployment\",\"this detailed guidance on ai and data protection\",\"data architecture infrastructure and resilience data architecture and infrastructure refers to the system standards and policies in which data are stored arranged and integrated\",\"you should also document any technical measures designed to reduce risks to the security and accuracy of personal data processed in your ai system\",\"this body is responsible for the use of algorithms related to online content cybersecurity data security and privacy\",\"cybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that ai systems are resilient against attempts to alter their use behaviour performance or compromise their security properties by malicious third parties exploiting the systems vulnerabilities\",\"this guidance therefore focuses on the data protection challenges that ml based ai may present while acknowledging that other kinds of ai may give rise to other data protection challenges\",\"keeping your data secure\",\"a number of mathematical and computer science techniques known as constrained optimisation aim to find the optimal solutions for minimising trade offs\",\"technical understanding of streaming data architectures\",\"the guidance focuses on specific risks and controls to ensure

will use this guidance as a basis to inform our audit functions under the data protection legislation\",\"privacy related risks may influence security bias and transparency and come with tradeoffs with these other characteristics\",\"multiple nsf programs support research that directly addresses many of these principles the national ai research institutes support research on all aspects of safe trustworthy fair and explainable ai algorithms and systems the cyber physical systems program supports research on developing safe autonomous and cyber physical systems with ai components the secure and trustworthy cyberspace program supports research on cybersecurity and privacy enhancing technologies in automated systems the formal methods in the field program supports research on rigorous formal verification and analysis of automated systems and machine learning and the designing accountable software systems program supports research on rigorous and reproducible methodologies for developing software systems with legal and regulatory compliance in mind\",\"if anonymising data this should be done at the earliest opportunity and consideration should be taken to ensure that the most appropriate methods of anonymisation are used eg natural language processingbased anonymisation differential privacy data masking aggregations\",\"in the context of ai the specific nature of the risks posed and the circumstances of your processing will require you to strike an appropriate balance between competing interests as you go about ensuring data protection compliance\",\"the algorithms use of data complies with privacy and data processing legislation\",\"if you are a provider of ai services you should ensure that they are designed in such a way as to allow organisations to fulfil their data protection obligations\",\"since ai systems operate as part of a larger chain of software components data flows organisational workflows and business processes you should take a holistic approach to security\",\"this section is aimed at technical specialists who are best placed to assess the security of an ai system and what personal data is required\",\"designers developers and deployers of automated systems should consider limited waivers of confidentiality including those related to trade secrets where necessary in order to provide meaningful oversight of systems used in sensitive domains incorporating measures to protect intellectual property and trade secrets from unwarranted disclosure as appropriate\",\"this guidance is divided into several parts covering different data protection principles and rights\",\"the security principle refers to security of the personal data  protecting it against unauthorised processing\",\"these are the ai act the general data protectionregulation the digital services act and eu law on non discrimination and equal treatment\",\"the proposal will only require removal of illegal content and will impose mandatory safeguards when users information is removed including the provision of explanatory information to the user complaint mechanisms supported by the service providers as well as external out of court dispute resolution mechanism\",\"while ai increases the importance of embedding data protection by design and default into an organisations culture and processes the technical complexities of ai systems can make this more difficult\",\"the personal information protection and electronic documents act provides important guardrails around how businesses use personal information\",\"the obligations would also include the necessary safeguards in order to protect users fundamental rights and ensure transparency\",\"this section explains how ai systems can exacerbate known security risks and make them more difficult to manage\",\"however the use of cybersecurity reviews by the cac which derive from the same primary data protection legislation suggest that active enforcement may take place\",\"this requires you to be responsible for complying with the data protection principles and for demonstrating that compliance\",\"storing and using these models therefore constitutes processing of personal data and as such the standard data protection provisions apply\",\"the ico is developing further security guidance which will include additional recommendations for the oversight and review of externally maintained source code from a data protection perspective as well as its implications for security and data protection by design\",\"the risk based approach of data protection law requires you to comply with your obligations and implement appropriate measures in the context of your particular circumstances  the nature scope context and purposes of the processing you intend to do and the risks this poses to individuals rights and freedoms\",\"as part of striking the required balance between the right to data protection and other fundamental rights in the context of your ai systems you will inevitably have to consider a range of competing considerations and interests\",\"some of these protections are already required by the us constitution or implemented under existing us laws\",\"for example in health the european health data space will facilitate non discriminatory access to health data and the training of artificial intelligence algorithms on those datasets in a privacy preserving secure timely transparent and trustworthy manner and with an appropriate institutional governance\",\"the processing shall be based on member state or union lawpublic safety and public health including disease prevention control and treatmenta high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environmentthe data processed are necessary for complying with one or more of the requirements referred to in title iii chapter  where those requirements cannot be effectively fulfilled by processing anonymised synthetic or other non personal datathere are effective monitoring mechanisms to identify if any high risks to the fundamental rights of the data subjects may arise during the sandbox experimentation as well as response mechanism to promptly mitigate those risks and where necessary stop the processingany personal data to be processed in the context of the sandbox are in a functionally separate isolated and protected data processing environment under the control of the participants and only authorised persons have access to that dataany personal data processed are not be transmitted transferred or otherwise accessed by other partiesany processing of personal data in the context of the sandbox do not lead to measures or decisions affecting the data subjectsany personal data processed in the context of the sandbox are deleted once the participation in the sandbox has terminated or the personal data has reached the end of its retention periodthe logs of the processing of personal data in the context of the sandbox are kept for the duration of the participation in the sandbox and  year after its termination solely for the purpose of and only as long as necessary for fulfilling accountability and

new uk gdpr\",\"the technical solutions to address ai specific vulnerabilities shall include where appropriate measures to prevent and control for attacks trying to manipulate the training dataset data poisoning inputs designed to cause the model to make a mistake adversarial examples or model flaws\",\"sensitive data includes data that can be used to infer sensitive information even systems that are not directly marketed as sensitive domain technologies are expected to keep sensitive data private\",\"resilience relates to robustness and goes beyond the provenance of the data to encompass unexpected or adversarial use or abuse or misuse of the model or data\",\"however you must take care not to conflate commercial interests with data protection requirements eg commercial security and data protection security and instead you should consider the extent to which such a trade off genuinely exists\",\"at first glance it may therefore be difficult to see how ai systems can comply with the data minimisation principle yet if you are using ai as part of your processing you are still required to do so\",\"data collection should be limited in scope with specific narrow identified goals to avoid mission creep  anticipated data collection should be determined to be strictly necessary to the identified goals and should be minimized as much as possible\",\"this guidance covers what we think is best practice for data protection compliant ai as well as how we interpret data protection law as it applies to ai systems that process personal data\",\"finally it covers striking the required balance between the right to data protection and other fundamental rights in the context of your ai system\",\"in these contexts you should consider the relevant legal frameworks beyond data protection\",\"as described above some of those protected characteristics are also special category data\",\"sensitive data and derived data should not be sold shared or made public as part of data brokerage or other agreements\",\"these sensitive domains require extra protections\",\"your use of ai must comply with the requirements of data protection law\",\"therefore more general data protection considerations are not addressed in this guidance except in so far as they relate to and are challenged by ai\",\"clear and well defined protocols for logging activity and for implementing mechanisms to support end to end auditability\",\"domains that have historically been singled out as deserving of enhanced data protections or where such enhanced protections are reasonably expected by the public include but are not limited to health family planning and care employment education criminal justice and personal finance\",\"in some cases applying privacy preserving techniques means that certain data used in ml systems is rendered pseudonymous or anonymous\",\"q how could the use of ai impact groups sharing protected characteristics\",\"comprehensivelyaddresssecurityconcernsrelatedtoevasionmodelextractionmem bership inference availability or other machine learning attacks\",\"the acts of transmission and of provision of access referred to in paragraph  include the automatic intermediate and transient storage of the information transmitted in so far as this takes place for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission in the communication network and provided that the information is not stored for any period longer than is reasonably necessary for the transmission\",\"many of the expectations listed here for privacy by design and use specific consent mirror those distributed to developers as best practices when developing for smart phone devices such as being transparent about how user data will be used asking for app permissions during their use so that the use context will be clear to users and ensuring that the app will still work if users deny or later revoke some permissions\",\"among other things the privacy act limits the storage of individual information in federal systems of records illustrating the principle of limiting the scope of data retention\",\"part two covers the lawfulness fairness and transparency of processing personal data in ai systems with sections covering lawful bases for processing personal data in ai systems assessing and improving ai system performance and mitigating potential discrimination to ensure fair processing\",\"requirements on data anonymization record keeping or on the assessment of high impact systems\",\"the information commissioners office ico has responsibility for enforcing compliance with data protection requirements andfinancial services firms also need to ensure compliance with the equality act  equality act in respect of which the equality and human rights commission ehrc has enforcement powers\",\"data privacy is a foundational and cross cutting principle required for achieving all others in this framework\",\"in many respects the standard requirements for maintaining code and managing security risks will apply to ai applications\",\"in sensitive domains entities should be especially careful to maintain the quality of data to avoid adverse consequences arising from decision making based on flawed or inaccurate data\",\"this section is about the accountability principle which makes you responsible for complying with data protection law and for demonstrating that compliance in any ai system that processes personal data\",\"care should be taken to balance individual privacy with evaluation data access needs in many cases policy based andor technological innovations and controls allow access to such data without compromising privacy\",\"provide enhanced protections for data related to sensitive domainsnecessary functions only\",\"data and metadata are sensitive if they pertain to an individual in a sensitive domain defined below are generated by

data geolocation data data related to interaction with the criminal justice system relationship history and legal status such as custody and divorce information and home work or school environmental data or have the reasonable potential to be used in ways that are likely to expose individuals to meaningful harm such as a loss of privacy or financial harm due to identity theft\",\"they also present challenges for compliance with the data minimisation principle\",\"the privacy act of  requires privacy protections for personal information in federal records systems including limits on data retention and also provides individuals a general right to access and correct their data\",\"while ensuring the rights of defence of the parties concerned in particular the right of access to the file it is essential that confidential information be protected\",\"such measures may become part of common real time monitoring techniques used to protect against other security threats such as rate limiting reducing the number of queries that can be performed by a particular user in a given time limit\",\"in each section we discuss what you must do to comply with data protection law as well as what you should do as good practice\",\"the big data report provided a strong foundation for understanding the data protection implications of these technologies\",\"as part of your obligation to implement data protection by design and by default you should consider statistical accuracy and the appropriate measures to evaluate it from the design phase and test these measures throughout the ai lifecycle\",\"this will help you apply appropriate security risk controls and monitor their effectiveness\",\"safety and soundness data  pra and fca data are a crucial element of ai\",\"also while

immediacy of the impact and the limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems operating in real time carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms

negative sentiment while im a christian was identified as expressing a positive sentiment\",\"you must include your lawful basis in your privacy notice along with the purposes\",\"while many criminal code offences can apply to malicious or even grossly negligent uses of ai systems these offences are not targeted to this behaviour and their application to potential uses of the technology involves some uncertainty and novelty\",\"these offences of a criminal nature aim to prohibit and punish ai related activities that are done by someone who is aware of or who appreciates the harm they are causing or at risk of causing\",\"a member state may decide to provide for the possibility to fully or partially authorise the use of real time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement within the limits and under the conditions listed in paragraphs  point   and\",\"surveillance or monitoring systems should be subject to heightened oversight that includes at a minimum assessment of potential harms during design before deployment and in an ongoing manner to ensure that the american publics rights opportunities and access are protected\",\"we understand the distinct benefits that ai can bring but also the risks it can pose to the rights and freedoms of individuals\",\"for example a facial recognition system could be trained to recognise faces but that functionality could be used for multiple purposes such as preventing crime authentication and tagging friends in a social network\",\"by observing the names and the confidence scores returned by the model they could reconstruct the face images associated with the individuals included in the training data\",\"protect the public from harm in a proactive and ongoing mannerconsultation\",\"provided the requirements on notices are met it should be possible for individuals or entities to notify multiple specific items of allegedly illegal content through a single notice\",\"moreover of the  criminal offences listed in the council framework decision jha some are in practice likely to be more relevant than others in that the recourse to real time remote biometric identification will foreseeably be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for the practical pursuit of the detection localisation identification or prosecution of a perpetrator or suspect of the different criminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the seriousness probability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences\",\"these are behaviours that are both sufficiently harmful to canadian society and exhibit moral blameworthiness on the part of those who do them\",\"for the purpose of this article the member state concerned shall be the member state where the offence is suspected to have taken place be taking place and likely to take place or the member state where the suspected offender resides or

characteristics such as the postcode you live in are proxies for a protected characteristic like race\",\"performed regularly tevv tasks can provide insights relative to technical societal legal and ethical standards or norms and can assist with anticipating impacts and assessing and tracking emergent risks\",\"you therefore still need to assess the risk of re identification\",\"the notion of remote biometric identification system as used in this regulation should be defined functionally as an ai system intended for the identification of natural persons at a distance through the comparison of a persons biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database and without prior knowledge whether the targeted person will be present and can be identified irrespectively of the particular technology processes or types of biometric data used\",\"both police and the public deserve to understand why and how such a system is making these determinations\",\"real life examples of how these principles can become reality through laws policies and practical technical and sociotechnical approaches to protecting rights opportunities and access\",\"identification of road signs for self driving vehicles\",\"to the extent that this regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use of ai systems for real time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement it is appropriate to base this regulation in as far as those specific

assessed by outlining a set of specific areas eg biometrics critical infrastructure education and vocational training and law enforcement and criteria eg the likelihood of the use of the ai system the potential extent of the harm and the reversibility of its outcome\",\"users of an ai system that generates or manipulates image audio or video content that appreciably resembles existing persons

the right to freedom of the arts and sciences guaranteed in the charter of fundamental rights of the eu and subject to appropriate safeguards or the rights and freedoms of third parties\",\"it is therefore appropriate to classify as high risk ai systems intended to be used by the competent public authorities charged with tasks in the fields of migration asylum and border control management as polygraphs and similar tools or to detect the emotional state of a natural person for assessing certain risks posed by natural persons entering the territory of a member state or applying for visa or

government actors to protect civil rights civil liberties and privacy in a manner consistent with but using alternate mechanisms to the specific principles discussed in this framework\",\"certain ai systems intended to interact with natural persons or to generate content may pose specific risks of impersonation or deception irrespective of whether they qualify as high risk or not\",\"you and your communities should be free from unchecked surveillance surveillance technologies should be subject to heightened oversight that includes at least pre deployment assessment of their potential harms and scope limits to protect privacy and civil liberties\",\"a first category concerns the risks associated with the misuse of their service through the dissemination of illegal content such as the dissemination of child sexual abuse material or illegal hate speech and the conduct of illegal activities such as the sale of products or services prohibited by union or national law including counterfeit products\",\"in addition the use of real time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to appropriate limits in time and space having regard in particular to the evidence or indications regarding the threats the victims or perpetrator\",\"such threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in accordance with national law contributes to ensure that the offence should be serious enough to potentially justify the use of real time remote biometric identification systems\",\"the status of trusted flaggers under this regulation shall be awarded upon application by any entities by the digital services coordinator of the member state in which the applicant is established where the applicant has demonstrated to meet all of the following conditionsit has particular expertise and competence for the purposes of detecting identifying and notifying illegal contentit represents collective interests and is independent from any online platformit carries out its activities for the purposes of submitting notices in a timely diligent and objective manner\",\"therefore the notion does not cover places that are private in nature and normally not freely accessible for third parties including law enforcement authorities unless those parties have been specifically invited or authorised such as homes private clubs offices warehouses and factories\",\"protect the public from unchecked surveillanceheightened oversight of surveillance\",\"finally the use of real time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is also prohibited unless certain limited exceptions apply\",\"this consideration is particularly relevant where you are using public task or legitimate interests as a lawful basis\",\"market surveillance authorities would have all powers under regulation eu  on market surveillance\",\"in view of the risks that they pose both types of remote biometric identification systems should be subject to specific requirements on logging capabilities and human oversight\",\"this purposefully overlapping framework when taken as a whole forms a blueprint to help protect the public from harm\",\"as regards paragraphs  point  and  each individual use for the purpose of law enforcement of a real time remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces shall be subject to a prior authorisation granted by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of the member state in which the use is to take place issued upon a reasoned request and in accordance with the detailed rules of national law referred to in paragraph\",\"surveillance systems should not be

intention to materially distort the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is likely to cause harm to that or another person\",\"the use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be prohibited except in three exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations where the use is strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest the importance of which outweighs the risks\",\"real life examples of how these principles can become reality through laws policies and practical technical and sociotechnical approaches to protecting rights opportunities and access\",\"regardless of authenticity the experience of harm to victims of non consensual intimate images can be devastatingly realaffecting their personal and professional lives and impacting their mental and physical health\",\"use of surveillance technologies has increased in schools and workplaces and when coupled with consequential management and evaluation decisions it is leading to mental health harms such as lowered self confidence anxiety depression and a reduced ability to use analytical reasoning\",\"therefore there is a need to put in place appropriate and proportionate safeguards against such misuse\",\"in view of the nature of the activities in question and the risks relating thereto those high risk ai systems should include in particular ai systems intended to be used by law enforcement authorities for individual risk assessments polygraphs and similar tools or to detect the emotional state of natural person to detect deep fakes for the evaluation of the reliability of evidence in criminal proceedings for predicting the occurrence or reoccurrence of an actual or potential criminal offence based on profiling of natural

learning in which the machine is fed input variables and an output variable unsupervised machine learning only uses input data\",\"complying with a request to erase training data does not entail erasing all ml models based on this data unless the models themselves contain that data or can be used to infer it\",\"for example if a data scientist wanted to teach a system to identify cats in different images they would feed the system with images of cats labelled as cats\",\"when designing and building ml applications data scientists will generally assume that all data used in training testing and operating the system will be aggregated in a centralised way and held in its full and original form by a single entity in multiple places throughout the ai systems lifecycle\",\"ml systems require large sets of training and testing data to be copied and imported from their original context of processing shared and stored in a variety of formats and places including with third parties\",\"for example support vector machines svms and k nearest neighbours knn models contain some of the training data in the model itself\",\"this is done for example by algorithmically suggesting ranking and prioritising information distinguishing through text or other visual representations or otherwise curating information provided by recipients\",\"because the ml model has not been trained on enough data about similar individuals it can make incorrect predictions or classifications\",\"so called black box algorithms where the researcher knows what data is fed into the algorithm and what comes out but might not be able to interpret it in actionable human terms are central to considering this issue\",\"training an ai system on errorstrewn data can result in poor results due to the dataset not containing clear patterns for the model to explore when making a prediction\",\"the potential biases associated with machine learning are not unique to machine learning methods for example sample bias is a typical ethical and quality consideration within traditional statistical methods and mitigations used to limit bias in traditional statistical methods can certainly help when thinking about machine learning\",\"these benefits are largely due to the uplift in predictive power more granular classification and segmentation ability to capture non linear relationships and the ability to analyse larger volumes of data and new data sources such as unstructured and alternative data\",\"used by data scientists when evaluating and developing other types of machine learning algorithms\",\"for example if  of all emails received to an inbox are spam then you could create a  accurate classifier by simply labelling everything as spam\",\"this is where the model pays too much attention to the details of the training data effectively almost remembering particular examples from the training data rather than just the general patterns\",\"this guidance is underpinned by these general principles but focuses specifically on ethical considerations relating to machine learning which require us to take particular care\",\"machine learning  particularly when using predictive analytics  often involves linking data from multiple sources\",\"in general when an ai system learns from data as is the case with ml models the more data it is trained on the more statistically accurate it will be\",\"high quality training validation and testing data sets require the implementation of appropriate data governance and management practices\",\"but this would defeat the purpose of the classifier as no genuine email would get through\",\"machine learning models will sometimes perform differently in the real world than they did when being trained and so it is important that models are continuously modelled and audited so that any issues can be identified quickly\",\"as such machine learning is now used in multiple types of research\",\"these methods are good practice in data science but they also go some way towards meeting the data minimisation principle\",\"the data has been tagged with one or more labels\",\"machine learning techniqueclassification regression clustering dimensionality reduction or manifold learning ranking\",\"aside from svms and other models that contain examples from the training data by design some models might leak personal data by accident\",\"overfitting can happen where there are too many features included or where there are too few examples in the training data or both\",\"have the limitations of machine learning datatechnologies been considered\",\"this allows the attacker to infer that the person was in the training data\",\"predictive it predicts what will happen based on trends and patterns from the data given\",\"a widely used healthcare algorithm relied on the cost of each patients past medical care to predict future medical needs recommending early interventions for the patients deemed most at risk\",\"for example you may think it more important to rectify an incorrectly recorded customer delivery address than to rectify the same incorrect address in training data\",\"the information collected from machine learning can be descriptive it uses data to explain a phenomenon\",\"for example a retailer creating a model to predict consumer purchases based on past transactions needs a large dataset of customer transactions to train the model on\",\"machine learning application natural language processing nlp computer vision anomaly detection time series analysis recommender systems\",\"there are several significant examples relating to ai which we discuss in detail elsewhere the interests in training a sufficiently accurate ai system and in reducing the quantity of personal data processed to train that system see how should we balance data minimisation and statistical accuracy\",\"one of these libraries contains a software function to convert the raw training data into the format required to train the ml model\",\"the algorithms are robust unbiased fair and explainable\",\"for example a model for predicting future purchases based on customers purchase history would tend to be more statistically accurate the more customers are included in the training data\",\"in supervised learning the objective is to make predictions using a set of data\",\"those models can be used to make classifications or predictions about new data points\",\"of course despite these ethical considerations there are huge benefits to using machine learning methods\",\"machine learning can be supervised learning which allows an ai model to learn from labelled training data for example training an ai model to help tag content on gov uk\",\"any data used as the target of a prediction process should receive particular attention to the quality and validity of the predicted outcome or label to ensure the goal of the automated system is appropriately identified and measured\",\"used to make a prediction during deployment and the result of the prediction itself\",\"this is a phenomenon in ai known as concept drift\",\"such approaches may include a classification scheme to encompass different methodologies or a mapping of the characteristics of ai such as the german financial services regulators consultation paper on machine learning in risk models the oecd classification system and the uk governments proposed framework for regulating ai\",\"this means that the model learns without supervision to discover its own patterns and information from the data\",\"federated learning is relatively new but has several large scale applications\",\"similarly various methods exist to create ml models which optimise statistical accuracy while also minimising mathematically defined measures of discrimination\",\"training validation and testing data sets should be sufficiently relevant representative and free of errors and complete in view of the intended purpose of the system\",\"were there any limitations to your research or the machine learning methods that you used\",\"the training should reoccur regularly to ensure it is up to date with the system and to ensure the system is used appropriately\",\"how did you train the system which methods did you use throughout the process\",\"for example human readable words are normally translated into a series of numbers called a feature vector\",\"and any new features added to an existing dataset may be relevant to what the model is trying to predict\",\"recent advances in machine learning such as deep learning have made it even easier for ai systems to detect patterns in the world that are reflected in seemingly unrelated data\",\"however users integrate the functions the process should be iterative with cross referencing between functions as necessary\",\"machine learning is the most widely used form of ai and has contributed to innovations like self driving cars speech recognition and machine translation\",\"for example a text classification algorithm might not be as accurate as a human when classifying documents however they can perform at a far higher scale and speed than a human\",\"helpfulwhat is machine learning\",\"machine learning can be supervised learning which allows an ai model to learn from labelled training data for example training a model to help tag content on gov uk\",\"this means that machine learning methods have an incredibly wide range of application\",\"for example the training data may be incomplete or unrepresentative of the correct population\",\"for example smartphone predictive text systems are based on the words that users have previously typed\",\"if an individual was in the training data then the model will be disproportionately confident in a prediction about that person because it has seen them before\",\"it is important for all stakeholders to understand that they are interacting with machine learning and the conclusions and recommendations that come from a machine learning model\",\"so pre processing in machine learning terminology is still processing in data protection terminology and therefore data protection still applies\",\"supervised learning leads to a prediction or classification of a known quantity ie an outcome variable using patterns that the machine finds in the data to predict an outcome\",\"public good have the benefits of using machine learning for a project been clearly documented\",\"reinforcement machine learning trains models to make decision sequences by utilising a process of trial and error\",\"a continuous chain of human responsibility should be established through the full lifecycle of the machine learning model\",\"the model also used data from micro censuses to validate its outputs and provide valuable training data for the model\",\"there may be good reasons for using a black box approach  for example a black box algorithm may provide better quality or more accurate data than a more transparent alternative  but it is important to note however that there are explainable machine learning algorithms which should be considered to optimise transparency where it is appropriate to do so\",\"an early demonstration of this kind of attack concerned a medical model designed to predict the correct dosage of an anticoagulant using patient data including genetic biomarkers\",\"maintaining the provenance of training data and supporting attribution of the ai systems decisions to subsets of training data can assist with both transparency and accountability\",\"specifically the training data contains both the target variable ie the thing that the model is aiming to predict or classify and several predictor variables ie the input used to make the prediction\",\"unsupervised learning which is training an ai algorithm to use unlabelled and unclassified information\",\"for example it can provide more accurate information forecasts and predictions leading to better outcomes for example more accurate medical diagnoses\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"ML

people impacted by those choices\",\"for example in certain scenarios tradeoffs may emerge between optimizing for interpretability and achieving privacy\",\"assessing the interpretability requirements should be part of the design phase allowing you to develop explanation tools as part of the system if required\",\"risk from lack of explainability may be managed by describing how ai systems function with descriptions tailored to individual differences such as the users role knowledge and skill level\",\"if we receive a request for disclosure of this information we will take your indications into

present the main parameters for such recommender systems in an easily comprehensible manner to ensure that the recipients understand how information is prioritised for them\",\"while the explaining decisions made with ai guidance already covers the challenge of ai explainability for individuals in substantial detail this guidance includes some additional considerations about ai explainability within the organisation eg for internal oversight and compliance\",\"meaningful transparency provides access to appropriate levels of information based on the stage of the ai lifecycle and tailored to the role or knowledge of ai actors or individuals interacting with or using the ai system\",\"however such a description is necessary as part of a dpia\",\"there are two broad audiences\",\"being transparent about the way in which data is used and how our research is carried out allows others to verify the results of a project via replication and the accuracy or inaccuracy of a model enabling researchers to determine whether the model is sufficient and whether it is suitable for further use\",\"take a minute to consider what information you may not find helpful if you were approached by someone who wanted to tell you about their machine learning research from the perspective of the audience you are trying to communicate with\",\"ensure explainability\",\"as transparency tools for ai systems and related documentation continue to evolve developers of ai systems are encouraged to test different types of transparency tools in cooperation with ai deployers to ensure that ai systems are used as intended\",\"those in charge of designing the front end interface of an ai system must understand the needs thought processes and behaviours of human reviewers and allow them to effectively intervene\",\"in our work to date we have developed some indicative example scenarios\",\"explainable systems can be debugged and monitored more easily and they lend themselves to more thorough documentation audit and governance\",\"depending on the question between  and  of the respondents used the free text option to insert comments\",\"if stakeholders from participants to analysts are not given clear information to help them understand the research then this risks promoting harmful practices\",\"transparency\",\"in that context it shall inform the notified body concerned about the objections raised and give it the possibility to make its views known\",\"particularly the interpretability requirements and effective user interface design to support human reviews and interventions\",\"interpretability can answer the question of why a decision was made by the system and its meaning or context to the user\",\"in these cases consideration should be given as to how information can be communicated transparently and in ways that are easy to understand to relevant non expert communities as necessary\",\"in some other areas a ground truth may be unattainable\",\"such sources should be carefully validated against the risk of collateral consequences\",\"how can you present your research findings in a way that is relevant to policy and which

will also explain the importance of identifying and understanding controller processor relationships\",\"an independent study showed that the model predictions underperformed relative to the designers claims while also causing alert fatigue by falsely alerting likelihood of sepsis\",\"the bors principles are explicitly framed as an overlapping set of backstops against potential harms while the executive order  emphasises that the benefits of using ai systems must outweigh the risks\",\"further users who use an ai system to generate or manipulate image audio or video content that appreciably resembles existing persons places or events and would falsely appear to a person to be authentic should disclose that the content has been artificially created or manipulated by labelling the artificial intelligence output accordingly and disclosing its artificial origin\",\"the lack of notice or an explanation makes it harder for those performing child maltreatment assessments to validate the risk assessment and denies parents knowledge that could help them contest a decision\",\"explanations and documentation of risks based on empirical evidence of incidents\",\"for example existing frameworks and guidance are unable to adequately manage the problem of harmful bias in ai systems\",\"the second containing a more high level description of the processing and explaining the logic of how the personal data inputs relate to the outputs affecting individuals this may also support you in fulfilling your obligation to explain ai decisions to individuals\",\"instead they are intended to represent a statistically informed guess as to something which may be true about the individual now or in the future\",\"though not synonymous issues of transparency and explainability are inextricably linked with one another and so for the purpose of this guidance the two challenges will be addressed together\",\"explainability then is not black and white and should be seen more as a sliding scale\",\"for example when providing an explanation to individuals there may be a risk that doing so reveals proprietary information about how the ai model works\",\"thoroughly understand the problem and the needs of different users\",\"another significant challenge raised by ai is explainability\",\"techniques used to automate the process of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many forms\",\"however it is difficult to determine whether an opaque system possesses such characteristics and to do so over time as complex systems evolve\",\"transparency is particularly important to consider when using technologies such as machine learning especially with the aim of reproducibility in mind\",\"explainability then can be used to define machine learning techniques that as humans we are adequately able to understand trust and manage\",\"some types of ai systems may have outputs which are difficult for a human reviewer to interpret for example those which rely on complex high dimensional deep learning models\",\"where applicable the factors that must be addressed in the explanation have been expanded to include the type of personal information that was used its source and the reasons or principal factors that led to the prediction recommendation or decision\",\"helping users make sure users feel confident in using interpreting and challenging any outputs or insights generated by the model\",\"the explanation provided by a system should accurately reflect the factors and the influences that led to a particular decision and should be meaningful for the particular customization based on purpose target and level of risk\",\"if in doubt assume that the group that you are interacting with has no experience of machine learning  it is better to simplify your language to ensure that stakeholders understand your message\",\"notice and explanations also serve an important safety and efficacy purpose allowing experts to verify the reasonableness of a recommendation before enacting it\",\"one approach to address low interpretability is the use of local explanations using methods like local interpretable model agnostic explanation lime which provides an explanation of a specific output rather than the model in general\",\"this means it makes it substantially less certain which words were noise and which words were actually typed by a specific user\",\"article transposition\",\"consider this from the perspective of the audience you are trying to communicate with\",\"as a starting point you should train or retrain your human reviewers to understand how an ai system works and its limitations\",\"in cases of high dimensional andor derived attributes such justifications can be provided as overall descriptions of the attribute generation process and appropriateness\",\"summary reporting should document the determinations made based on the above considerations including the responsible entities for accountability purposes the goal and use cases for the system identified users and impacted populations the assessment of notice clarity and timeliness the assessment of the explanations validity and accessibility the assessment of the level of risk and the account and assessment of how explanations are tailored including to the purpose the recipient of the explanation and the level of risk\",\"tolimit the disclosure to the necessary minimum and prevent blanket requests\",\"a positive opinion should be accompanied by comments where the auditor wishes to include remarks that do not have a substantial effect on the outcome of the audit\",\"in some cases insufficient explanations may prompt individuals to resort to other rights unnecessarily\",\"how have you arrived at these findings\",\"the white paper on ai further developed this inclusive approach inciting comments from more than  stakeholders including over  additional position papers\",\"however many people may not be able to understand or interpret an algorithm\",\"these could include inappropriate model choices errors in the model design or construction lack of explainability unexpected behaviour unintended consequences degradation in model performance model or concept drift and more\",\"however the exact information required in these reports is currently unclear\",\"explainability refers to a representation of the mechanisms underlying ai systems operation whereas interpretability refers to the meaning of ai systems output in the context of their designed functional purposes\",\"humans perceive and derive meaning from ai system output and explanations in different ways reflecting different individual preferences traits and skills\",\"trustworthiness characteristics explained in this document influence each other\",\"if the choice is taken that an opaque machine learning algorithm is to be used over a more explainable one researchers may need to consider how this can be communicated to a non specialist audience\",\"the exercise below may help analysts think about these concepts and communicate with users effectively\",\"the core issues regarding ai and the transparency principle are addressed in explaining decisions made with ai guidance so are not discussed in detail here\",\"the nature of your relationship with individuals\",\"anticipate when the system may be misleading or wrong and why\",\"these problems are well documented\",\"while approximation and simplification may be necessary for the system to succeed based on the explanatory purpose and target of the explanation or to account for the risk of fraud or other concerns related to revealing decision making information such simplifications should be done in a scientifically supportable way\",\"where appropriate based on the explanatory system error ranges for the explanation should be calculated and included in the explanation with the choice of presentation of such information balanced with usability and overall interface complexity concerns\",\"communicating with non experts when using machine learning techniques to ensure transparency\",\"provide meaningful explanations for either rejecting or accepting the ai systems output  a decision they should be responsible for\",\"the brevity clarity and accessibility of the notice and instructions should be assessed eg via user experience research\",\"in that regard is should be determined objectively on the basis of all relevant circumstances whether the presentation could lead to such a belief on the side of an average and reasonably well informed consumer\",\"how can you present the information in a way that is concise and easy to read or visualise\",\"explanations should be targeted to specific audiences and clearly state that audience\",\"while these approaches provide theoretical guarantees it can be hard to meaningfully put them into practice\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"Explainability, transparency and interpretability of

processes should be maintained and supported as long as the relevant automated system continues to be in use\",\"when automated systems make up part of the attainment process alternative timely human driven processes should be provided\",\"to this end automated systems that collect use share or store data related to these sensitive domains should meet additional expectations\",\"however automated systems should not be allowed to directly intervene in high risk situations such as sentencing decisions or medical care without human consideration\",\"automated systems with the intended purpose of violating the safety of others should not be developed or used systems with such safety violations as identified unintended consequences should not be used until the risk can be mitigated\",\"these mechanisms should be tested to ensure that users who have trouble with the automated system are able to use human consideration and fallback with the understanding that it may be these users who are most likely to need the human assistance\",\"time critical systems include but are not limited to voting related systems automated building access and other access systems systems that form a critical component of healthcare and systems that have the ability to withhold wages or otherwise cause immediate financial penalties\",\"robustness requires not only that the system perform exactly as it does under expected uses but also that it should perform in ways that minimize potential harms to people if it is operating in an unexpected setting\",\"processes for tracking responding to and recovering from incidents and errors are followed and documented\",\"before deployment and in a proactive and ongoing manner potential risks of the automated system should be identified and mitigated\",\"outlines processes documents and organizational schemes that anticipate identify and manage the risks a system can pose including to users and others across society  and procedures to achieve those outcomes\",\"rights that individuals have about solely automated decisions that affect them in legal or similarly significant ways are discussed in more detail in what is the role of human oversight as these rights raise particular challenges when using ai\",\"systems should undergo pre deployment testing risk identification and mitigation and ongoing monitoring that demonstrate they are safe and effective based on their intended use mitigation of unsafe outcomes including those beyond the intended use and adherence to domain specific standards\",\"the technical sustainability of these systems ultimately depends on their safety including their accuracy reliability security and robustness\",\"this framework applies to  automated systems that  have the potential to meaningfully impact the american publics rights opportunities or access to critical resources or services\",\"instructions should be provided in an accessible form and should be easily findable by those impacted by the automated system\",\"the availability of human consideration and fallback along with associated training and safeguards against human bias should be proportionate to the potential of the automated system to meaningfully impact rights opportunities or access\",\"these monitoring procedures should be in place for the lifespan of the deployed automated system\",\"you should be protected from inappropriate or irrelevant data use in the design development and deployment of automated systems and from the compounded harm of its reuse\",\"where they use automated means for that processing or decision making they shall include information on such use in the notification referred to in paragraph\",\"any significant risks to health and safety and fundamental rights identified during the development and testing of such systems shall result in immediate mitigation and failing that in the suspension of the development and testing process until such mitigation takes place\",\"document and demonstrate how your system is compliant and justify the choices you have made\",\"it sets obligations to assess the risks their systems pose to develop appropriate risk management tools to protect the integrity of their services against the use of manipulative techniques\",\"this framework instead shares a broad forward leaning vision of recommended principles for automated system development and use to inform private and public involvement with these systems where they have the potential to meaningfully impact rights opportunities or access\",\"in addition to being able to opt out and use a human alternative the american public deserves a human fallback system in the event that an automated system fails or causes harm\",\"as a key component of the directive on automated decision making there are varying degrees of compliance based on the impact of each system\",\"however if grave or frequent mistakes are identified you need to take immediate steps to understand and rectify the underlying issues and if necessary suspend the use of the automated system\",\"monitoring through measurement and assessment of high impact ai systems and their output is critical in supporting effective human oversight\",\"automated systems should not be designed with an intent or reasonably foreseeable possibility of endangering your safety or the safety of your community\",\"systems should not employ user experience and design decisions that obfuscate user choice or burden users with defaults that are privacy invasive\",\"the human element can act as a valuable safeguard against harmful outcomes providing contextual knowledge that may be outside the capability of a model and identifying where an automated decision could be problematic and therefore requiring further review\",\"an assessment should be done to determine the level of risk of the automated system\",\"they should also set out clearly who is responsible for the testing and final validation of the system before it is deployed\",\"however a key difference is that in solely automated contexts human intervention is only required on a case by case basis to safeguard the individuals rights whereas for a system to qualify as not solely automated meaningful human intervention is required in every decision\",\"governments at all levels have existing public consultation processes that may be applied when considering the use of new automated systems and existing product development and testing practices already protect the american public from many potential harms\",\"such authorisation should in principle be obtained prior to the use except in duly justified situations of urgency that is situations where the need to use the systems in question is such as to make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before commencing the use\",\"training your staff is pivotal to ensuring an ai system is considered partly automated\",\"part four covers compliance with individual rights including rights related to automated decision making\",\"examples of automated systems for which the blueprint for an ai bill of

are likely to have a material effect on subsequent changes to the aida  and any regulations enacted after it becomes law\",\"they can be disproportionately affected by restrictions and removal measures following from unconscious or conscious biases potentially embedded in the notification systems by users and third parties as well as replicated in automated content moderation tools used by platforms\",\"the regulated activities laid out in the aida would then be associated with distinct obligations that are proportionate to the risk\",\"providing for a robust monitoring and evaluation mechanism is crucial to ensure that the proposal will be effective in achieving its specific objectives\",\"in addition where the minister has reasonable grounds to believe that the use of a high impact system could result in harm or biased output the minister may require by order a person to provide specific records relating to that system\",\"those responsible for an ai system will be required to assess whether the ai system is a high impact system\",\"regulations defining which systems would be considered high impact as well as specific requirements would be developed in consultation with a broad range of stakeholders to ensure that they are effective at protecting the interests of the canadian public while avoiding imposing an undue burden on the canadian ai ecosystem\",\"first the commissioner could request by order the provision of records ie about system assessment risk management monitoring measures and data anonymization with the ability to request additional records if there were to be reasonable grounds to believe that the use of a high impact system could result in harm or biassed outputs\",\"in addition to obligations associated with risk assessment and mitigation businesses responsible for regulated activities associated with a high impact system would also be required to notify the minister if a system causes or is likely to cause material harm\",\"in settings where the consequences are high as determined by a risk assessment or extensive oversight is expected eg in criminal justice or some public sector settings explanatory mechanisms should be built into the system design so that the systems full behavior can be explained in advance ie only fully transparent models should be used rather than as an after the decision interpretation\",\"the directive which came into force in april  is part of the governments efforts to utilise ai to make or assist in making administrative decisions to improve service delivery\",\"businesses who design or develop a high impact ai system would be expected to take measures to identify and address risks with regards to harm and bias document appropriate use and limitations and adjust the measures as needed\",\"these actors can assist in providing context and understanding potential and actual impacts\",\"high impact systemsthe existing definition of a high impact system is vague and will be addressed by criteria to be established by regulation\",\"aida creates three new criminal offences to directly prohibit and address specific behaviours of concern\",\"article evaluation and targeted review\",\"the existing definition of a high impact system is vague and will be addressed by criteria to be established by regulation\",\"this would enable the government to avoid imposing undue impacts on the ai ecosystem\",\"it is intended to encapsulate a broad range of adverse impacts that may result across the sectors of the economy\",\"for example more vulnerable groups such as children may face greater risk of harm from a high impact ai system and necessitate specific risk mitigation efforts\",\"businesses who make a high impact ai system available for use would be expected to consider potential uses when deployed and take measures to ensure users are aware of any restrictions on how the system is meant to be used and understand its limitations\",\"negative impact or harm can be experienced by individuals groups communities organizations society the environment and the planet\",\"map  impacts to individuals groups communities organizations and society are characterized\",\"omb also points to numerous examples of effective and proactive stakeholder engagement including the community based participatory research program developed by the national institutes of health and the participatory technology assessments developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration\",\"individual harms collective harms and biased outputthe aida addresses two types of adverse impacts associated with high impact ai systems\",\"measures to enhance transparency and accountability should also consider the impact of these efforts on the implementing entity including the level of necessary resources and the need to safeguard proprietary information\",\"for the private sector the aida lists a series of requirements that entail measures with respect to anonymized data the assessment of whether a system is high impact and risk mitigation record keeping and reporting obligations and the publishing of a publicly available ai statement\",\"as mentioned above however impact is also vertically assessed along the dimensions of  rights ii health and well being iii economic loss and iv sustainability\",\"the aida imposes regulatory requirements for both ai systems generally and those ai systems specifically referred to as high impact systems which we discuss in further detail below\",\"among other things it will provide guidance on matters related to the implementation of the ai act including on enforcement matters\",\"how does the aida protect canadians from collective harms\",\"such assessment would also likely consider whether such aharmonisation would need to be coupled with mandatory insurance to ensure effectiveness\",\"impact assessmentin line with its better regulation policy the commission conducted an impact assessmentfor this proposal examined by the commissions regulatory scrutiny board\",\"the impact assessment report was further revised along these lines notably in clarifying the interlinks between the digital services act and the broader regulatory framework providing more detailed descriptions of the policy options and a more detailed analysis of the underlying evidence addressed in the revised impact assessment report\",\"in addition to administrative penalties the aida would also introduce offences that include significant fines and potential imprisonment for non compliance\",\"however the aida requires an election a person may be subject to an administrative penalty for a violation or more serious sanctions of an offence\",\"in addition to conducting a dpia you may also be required to undertake other kinds of impact assessments or do so voluntarily\",\"when outcomes go beyond target levels you should have processes to swiftly assess compliance and take action if necessary\",\"the other costs will be supported from the dep\",\"when these involve things like evaluation or scoring systematic monitoring and large scale processing the requirement to do a dpia is triggered\",\"for example amps could be applied in the case of clear violations where other attempts to encourage compliance had failed\",\"in terms of social impacts the directive will increase societal trust in ai technologies andaccess to an effective justice system\",\"ai can benefit the public sector in a number of ways\",\"following a similar pattern the proposed legislation aida will require the persons responsible for an artificial intelligence system to conduct an assessment on whether it is a high impact system\",\"improve public services for example providing service providers moreaccurate and detailed information of citizens with similar needs or interests to provide personalised public services tailored to individual circumstances\",\"ai system impact assessment approaches can help ai actors understand potential impacts or harms within specific contexts\",\"for example while aida would require notification for all high impact systems that are likely to cause material harm the draft ai act would only require it in case of a serious incident or malfunctioning\",\"first the sector specific interventions address a small subset of issues eg\",\"it is intended to build understanding among stakeholders and canadians on the proposed legislation as well to support parliamentary consideration of the bill\",\"the assessment of the economic and social impacts identified and the comparison of its effectiveness efficiency coherence and proportionality showed that option  would most effectively meet the objectives of the intervention by establishing the proportionate framework fit for adapting to emerging challenges in the dynamic digital world\",\"aida provides for two types of penalties for regulatory non compliance  administrative monetary penalties amps and prosecution of regulatory offences  as well as a separate mechanism for true criminal offences\",\"all organizations responsible for an ai system will be required to assess whether the ai system is a high impact system\",\"the legislative financial statement accompanying this proposal for a regulation covers the budgetary impacts for the regulation itself\",\"this includes the proactive documentation of policies processes and measures implemented\",\"at this time it is difficult to evaluate the impact and scope of the aida  and we will have to wait for the regulation to define a high impact system\",\"the federal governments directive also uses impact level definitions little or no impact to very high impact and based on the degree of impact the deputy head or treasury board will be responsible for approval of the system\",\"this will be undertaken on two levels both at the overall system level and at the individual regulator level\",\"the impacts of the policy options on different categories of stakeholders economic operators business conformity assessment bodies standardisation bodies and other public bodies individualscitizens researchers are explained in detail in annex  of the impact assessment supporting this proposal\",\"unintended negative consequences creators have not thoroughly considered the potential negative impacts their systems may have on the individuals and communities they affect\",\"they would be held accountable for the creation and enforcement of appropriate internal governance processes and policies to achieve compliance with the aida\",\"it identifies activities involved in the lifecycle of a high impact ai system and imposes obligations for businesses carrying out those activities in order to ensure accountability at each point where risk may be introduced\",\"in addition the aida provides authority for the minister to designate an artificial intelligence and data commissioner whose role would be to assist in the administration and enforcement of the aida\",\"the aida is the first federal law in canada regulating the creation and use of ai systems and would create penalties for non compliance\",\"why is this research important for policy\",\"canadas focus on impact is similar to the uks which emphasises the actual impact of ai technologies rather than hypothetical risks as well as the usas blueprint for an ai bill of rights which focuses on the impacts ai systems can have on rights and democratic values\",\"the directive would also impactpositively on sdgs because effective legislation on transparency accountability andfundamental rights will direct ais potential to benefit individuals and society towardsachieving the sdgs\",\"furthermore it states that actors such as impact assessors and evaluators will provide technical human factor socio cultural and legal expertise to carry out impact assessments of ai systems including evaluating the requirements for ai system accountability combating bias examining the impacts of ai systems product safety liability and security among others\",\"main economic social and environmental impactsthe directive will contribute to the rollout of ai\",\"the aida would also mobilize external expertise in the private sector academia and civil society to ensure that enforcement activities are conducted in the context of a rapidly developing environment\",\"this algorithmic impact assessment should be made public whenever possible\",\"once the ecosystem and regulatory framework have sufficiently matured the aida does provide for the creation of an administrative monetary penalty amp scheme through regulation\",\"the office of management and budget omb has called for an expansion of opportunities for meaningful stakeholder engagement in the design of programs and services\",\"there are four different levels of impact from lower to higher\",\"the proposal also prohibits ai based social scoring for general purposes done by public authorities\",\"sections in this part deal with the ai specific implications of accountability including data protection impact assessments dpias and controller  processor responsibilities\",\"it is possible that what constitutes a high impact system will be similar to what the eu defines as a high risk ai system or it may take some of its framework from the directive\",\"relevancy should be established based on research backed demonstration of the causal influence of the data to the specific use case or justified more generally based on a reasonable expectation of usefulness in the domain andor for the system design or ongoing development\",\"regulatory requirementsaida would require that appropriate measures be put in place to identify assess and mitigate risks of harm or biased output prior to a high impact system being made available for use\",\"results of ex post evaluations stakeholder consultations and impact assessmentsex post evaluationsfitness checks of existing legislationthis proposal builds on the evaluation of the e commerce directive conducted as a back to back evaluation with the impact assessment accompanying the proposal\",\"for public authorities the proposed option would cut the costs brought by the inefficiencies and duplications in the existing set up for the cooperation of authorities\",\"it states that audits that confirm that a system is performing as intended will be an important part of making impact assessments\",\"natural persons applying for or receiving public assistance benefits and services from public authorities are typically dependent on those benefits and services and in a vulnerable position in relation to the responsible authorities\",\"ensuring some of the additional protections proposed in this framework would require new laws to be enacted or new policies and practices to be adopted\",\"measures would be set through regulation and would be tailored to the context and risks associated with specific regulated activities in the lifecycle of a high impact ai system\",\"the open public consultation informing the impact assessment of this proposal confirmedthe problems explained above\",\"results of ex post evaluations stakeholderconsultations and impact assessments stakeholder consultationsan extensive consultation strategy was implemented to ensure a wide participation ofstakeholders throughout the policy cycle of this proposal\",\"such action is especially needed in high impact sectors including climate change environment and health the public sector finance mobility home affairs and agriculture\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"AIDA and high impact AI

continuous monitoring\",\"they automatically adapt how functions are carried out it is necessary to provide rules establishing that changes to the algorithm and its performance that have been pre determined by the provider and assessed at the moment of the conformity assessment should not constitute a substantial modification\",\"measure  feedback processes for end users and impacted communities to report problems and appeal system outcomes are established and integrated into ai system evaluation metrics\",\"recall or sensitivity the percentage of all cases that are in fact positive that are identified as such\",\"there is a risk that statistical accuracy is misconstrued in these situations so that ai systems are seen as being highly statistically accurate even though they are reflecting the average of what a set of human labellers thought rather than objective truth\",\"assess and refine performance\",\"in some cases although it is not a legal requirement it may be good practice for you to maintain two versions of an assessment with the first presenting a thorough technical description for specialist audiences\",\"entities should conduct regular independent audits and take prompt corrective measures to maintain accurate timely and complete data\",\"measure  test sets metrics and details about the tools used during tevv are documented\",\"measure  the ai model is explained validated and documented and ai system output is interpreted within its context  as identified in the map function  to inform responsible use and governance\",\"statistical accuracy to refer to the accuracy of an ai system itself\",\"testing procedures shall be suitable to achieve the intended purpose of the ai system and do not need to go beyond what is necessary to achieve that purpose\",\"ultimately trustworthiness is a social concept that ranges across a spectrum and is only as strong as its weakest characteristics\",\"ballot curing laws in at least  states require a fallback system that allows voters to correct their ballot and have it counted in the case that a voter signature matching algorithm incorrectly flags their ballot as invalid or there is another issue with their ballot and review by an election official does not rectify the problem\",\"by contrast for reasons of consistency with the existing product safety legislation the conformity assessments of ai systems that are safety components of products will follow a system with third party conformity assessment procedures already established under the relevant sectoral product safety legislation\",\"measure  ai systems are evaluated for trustworthy characteristics\",\"measurement of validity accuracy robustness and reliability contribute to trustworthiness and should take into consideration that certain types of failures can cause greater harm\",\"as stated in our guidance on special category data if you use profiling with the intention of inferring special category data then this is special category data irrespective of whether the inferences are incorrect\",\"these measures should reflect the balance between two different kinds of errors\",\"this measure looks to embed accountability in all aspects of a firms use of ai and ml and helps ensure the technology and its underlying data is appropriately understood tested deployed and monitored\",\"new types of measurement qualitative and quantitative may need to be developed\",\"the audit report should be substantiated so as to give a meaningful account of the activities undertaken and the conclusions reached\",\"chapter  sets the framework for notified bodies to be involved as independent third parties in conformity assessment procedures while chapter  explains in detail the conformity assessment procedures to be followed for each type of high risk ai system\",\"accuracy is defined as closeness of results of observations computations or estimates to the true values or the values accepted as being true measures of accuracy should consider computational centric measures eg false positive and false negative rates human ai teaming and demonstrate external validity generalizable beyond the training conditions\",\"similarly you should agree regular updates and reviews of statistical accuracy to guard against changing population data and concept model drift\",\"however overall statistical accuracy is not a particularly useful measure and usually needs to be broken down into different measures\",\"however as said above predictions are not inaccurate if they are intended as prediction scores as opposed to statements of fact\",\"statistical accuracy is also an important consideration if you outsource the development of an ai system to a third party either fully or partially or purchase an ai solution from an external vendor\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"Testing and monitoring AI

legal or similarly significant effects on individuals you must follow the safeguards laid out in the gdpr and dpa\",\"for example if a policy decision was made on the basis of your project would the public be comfortable with this\",\"what are the assumptions related to this recommendation\",\"you therefore need to evaluate this based on your own context\",\"automated decisions in this context are decisions made without human intervention which have legal or similarly significant effects on data subjects\",\"predicts how a user will rate a given item to make new recommendations\",\"introduce simple ways for them to request human intervention or challenge a decision\",\"in many cases trade offs are not precisely quantifiable but this should not lead to arbitrary decisions\",\"your dpia should show evidence of your consideration of less risky alternatives if any that achieve the same purpose of the processing and why you didnt choose them\",\"any consent requests should be brief be understandable in plain language and give you agency over data collection and the specific context of use current hard to understand notice and choice practices for broad uses of data should be changed\",\"therefore you need to assess which features  and therefore what data  are relevant for your purpose and only process that data\",\"any use of sensitive data or decision process based in part on sensitive data that might limit rights opportunities or access whether the decision is automated or not should go through a thorough ethical review and monitoring both in advance and by periodic review eg via an independent ethics committee or similarly robust process\",\"therefore such approaches will only be lawful if based on a different substantial public

the right to have access to the file while respecting confidentiality and professional and business secrecy as well as the obligation to give meaningful reasons for the decisions\",\"many statistical models can also be designed to provide a confidence score alongside each output which could help a human reviewer in their own decision making\",\"you should consider both the final decision and any automated decisions which significantly affected the decision making process\",\"under articles   and   you must tell people whose data you are processing that you are doing so for automated decision making and give them meaningful information about the logic involved as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of the processing for them\",\"when designing and evaluating an automated system steps should be taken to evaluate multiple models and select the one that has the least adverse impact modify data input choices or otherwise identify a system with fewer disparities\",\"you should always think carefully from the start whether it is appropriate to automate any prediction or decision making process\",\"this should also include whether an individual requested human intervention expressed any views contested the decision and whether you changed the decision as a result\",\"you should be aware that a decision does not fall outside the scope of article  just because a human has rubber stamped it\",\"simple rules which set conditions under which certain inferences can be made as is the case with decision trees are easier to interpret\",\"dealing with tradeoffs requires taking into account the decision making context\",\"the prioritisation criteria and rationale for your final decision\",\"human alternatives consideration

whether the project fits with the government organisations use of ai systems\",\"believe that a solely automated ai system will more fully achieve the intended outcome of your processing but that it may carry more risks to individuals than a partly automated system\",\"you should know how and why an outcome impacting you was determined by an automated system including when the automated system is not the sole input determining the outcome\",\"the use of a human alternative should be triggered by an opt out process\",\"ai and reasonable steps the concept of reasonable steps is a core element of

your relationship with the individual and the purpose of the processing\",\"this is because it does not involve directly making any decisions about individuals\",\"this includes making sure you provide users with specific and easily accessible information about the automated decision making process\",\"since using an individuals data for the purposes of training an ai system does not normally constitute making a solely automated decision with legal or similarly significant effects you only need to provide information about these decisions when you are taking them\",\"the ico has explained that the human input needs to be meaningful and a decision does not fall outside article  just because a human has rubber stamped it\",\"youll need to make sure your ai system is compliant with gdpr and the data protection act  dpa  including the points which relate to automated decision making\",\"at the same time you must remember that it is your responsibility to decide which lawful

by the human reviewers\",\"you must think about what features you expect the ai system to consider and which additional factors the human reviewers should take into account before finalising their decision\",\"however if you process disability status using an ai system to make decisions about individuals which produce legal or similarly significant effects on them you must have explicit consent from the individual or be able to meet one of the substantial public interest conditions laid out in schedule  of the dpa\",\"this means the resulting decisions are effectively solely automated\",\"if you want to use automated processes to make decisions with legal or similarly significant effects on individuals you must follow the safeguards laid out in the gdpr and dpa\",\"you need to document

for high risk ai systems only with the possibility for all providers of non high risk ai systems to follow a code of conduct\",\"the preferred option intends to define the appropriate division of responsibilities between intermediary services their recipients and authorities when fighting against illegal content online\",\"the degree and quality of human review and intervention before a final decision is made about an individual are key factors in determining whether an ai system is being used for automated decision making or merely as decision support\",\"you should therefore assess whether in your context lime and similar approaches will help the human decision maker to meaningfully interpret the ai system and its output\",\"reporting should include an assessment of timeliness and the extent of additional burden for human alternatives aggregate statistics about who chooses the human alternative along with the results of the assessment about brevity clarity and accessibility of notice and opt out instructions\",\"however there can be a number of different values and interests to consider and these may at times pull in different directions\",\"action plans can be developed to address these gaps to fulfill outcomes in a given category or subcategory\",\"however you should be aware that for consent to be valid individuals must also be able to withdraw consent as easily as they gave it\",\"for the public sector the directive on automated decision making requires completing an algorithmic impact assessment prior to the production of any automated decision system see

only carry out this type of decision making where the decision is necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract\",\"article  of the uk gdpr has additional rules to protect individuals if you are carrying out solely automated decision making that has legal or similarly significant effects on them\",\"however you should note that article  of the uk gdpr requires you to undertake a dpia if your use of ai involves systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects based on automated processing including profiling on which decisions are made that produce legal or similarly significant effects\",\"this might include temporarily increasing human scrutiny or ensuring that you have an appropriate lawful basis and safeguards in case the decision making does effectively become fully automated\",\"canadas directive on automated decision making aims to ensure that automated decision systems are deployed in a way that reduces risks to canadians and federal institutions while concurrently leading to more efficient accurate consistent and interpretable decisions made pursuant to canadian law\",\"when deciding on such measuresnational courts should take into account the need to ensure the right to an effectiveremedy and to a fair trial the legitimate interests of the parties and where appropriateof third parties and any potential harm to either party or where appropriate to thirdparties resulting from the granting or rejection of such measures\",\"you therefore need to evaluate this based on your own context\",\"for instance in the internet information

traditional decision making systems with ai you should consider running both concurrently for a period of time\",\"how you should justify document and demonstrate the approach you take including your decision to use ai for the processing in question\",\"for processing involving solely automated decision making that falls under part  of the dpa  the applicable safeguards will depend on regulations provided in the particular law authorising the automated decision making\",\"if the result of an assessment indicates residual high risk to individuals that you cannot sufficiently reduce you must consult with the ico prior to starting the processing\",\"it is important to note that while legitimate interests is the most flexible lawful basis for processing it is not always the most

this are\",\"you should address and document these considerations as part of your legitimate interests assessment lia\",\"the conditions under which human intervention qualifies as meaningful are similar to which render a decision non solely automated see what is the difference between solely automated and partly automated decision making below\",\"human intervention should involve a review of the decision which must be carried out by someone with the appropriate authority and capability to change that decision\",\"simulate complex systems to experiment with different policy options and

with the systems recommendations without judgement or challenge\",\"the decision to commission or deploy an ai system should be based on a contextual assessment of trustworthiness characteristics and the relative risks impacts costs and benefits and informed by a broad set of interested parties\",\"it is possible that you may not know in advance whether a solely or partly automated ai application will meet your needs best\",\"consider if you have a the right sort of data for the ai model to learn from\",\"this means that their review may not be sufficiently meaningful and the decision may end up being considered as solely automated\",\"this should include a robust risk based and independent approval process\",\"it is worth noting there are limits to the effectiveness of human involvement in an automated decision\",\"this is a highly iterative process requiring substantial amounts of data and will see your team probably build a number of ai models before deciding on the most effective and appropriate algorithm for your problem\",\"in the case of the directive on automated decision making the consequences for non compliance are listed separately in the framework for the management of compliance\",\"that approach should tailor the type and content of such rules to the intensity and scope of the risks that ai systems can generate\",\"you must break down and separate each distinct processing operation and identify the purpose and an appropriate lawful basis for each one in order to comply with the principle of lawfulness\",\"in particular part four covers how you can ensure meaningful human input in non automated or partly automated decisions and meaningful human review of solely automated decisions\",\"for example an online decision to award a business grant\",\"not

opened against a parent based on an algorithm and without the parent ever being notified that data was being collected and used as part of an algorithmic child maltreatment risk assessment\",\"you should make this determination before you start your processing\",\"however the resulting decisions could still constitute automated decision making within the meaning of data protection law\",\"although the directive is limited to automated decision making it may provide some insight into the regulatory framework that will follow if the aida becomes law\",\"if ai systems are only intended to support human decisions then your policies should specifically address additional risk factors such as automation bias and lack of interpretability\",\"basic systems which automate a relatively small number of explicitly written rules are unlikely to be considered ai eg a set of clearly expressed if then rules to determine a customers eligibility for a product\",\"although the individual has the right to request that you reconsider the decision or take a new decision that is not based solely on automated processing\",\"in certain contexts human involvement can be a regulatory requirement for instance under the uk gdpr automated decisions are treated differently to human decisions\",\"for example if you want to collect a wide range of features to explore different models to predict a variety of outcomes consent may be an appropriate lawful basis provided that you inform individuals about these activities and obtain valid consent\",\"youll need to make

electrical and electronics engineers ieee and the international telecommunication union itu\",\"using third party and open source code is a valid option\",\"in some cases it may be appropriate for an independent ethics review to be conducted before deployment\",\"there are several techniques described that would require the input of a technical specialist\",\"if your organisation is a central government department you may have to get approval from the gds to spend money on ai\",\"they may also use other sources available for use at a distance which offer a similar degree of reliability for the purpose of complying with this obligation\",\"however there are methods you can use to assess and mitigate trade offs that are relevant to many use cases\",\"while the implementation of codes of conduct should be measurable and subject to public oversight this should not impair the voluntary nature of such codes and the freedom of interested parties to decide whether to participate\",\"implement activity monitoring to allow for oversight and review throughout the entire project\",\"once you have secured budget youll need to allow enough time and resources to conduct a substantial discovery to show feasibility\",\"they may not be appropriate or sufficiently mature to deploy in your particular context\",\"some possible measures which you could use to identify evaluate minimise monitor and control those risks\",\"your ai solution will still need to be integrated into an end to end service for your users even if you are able to buy significant components off the shelf\",\"what can you do to try and protect against this possibility\",\"even if you hire your own ml engineers you may still rely significantly on third party frameworks and code libraries\",\"using virtual machines or containers emulations of a computer system that run inside but isolated from the rest of the it system may help here these can be pre configured specifically for ml tasks\",\"still these kinds of practices are deployed too rarely and unevenly\",\"there is no one ai technology\",\"you may still be able to make some technical decisions as a processor\",\"provide common environments for sharing data and code so the team can work collaboratively\",\"you can consider whether the team has validated the code\",\"unless there is a good reason not to do so you should seek and document the views of individuals or their representatives on the intended processing operation during a dpia\",\"it may be useful to discuss your project with colleagues who are not involved in the project as part of an independent review\",\"however buying your ai technology may not always be suitable as the specifics of your data and needs could mean the supplier would have to build from scratch or significantly customise an existing ai model\",\"however it would not apply to ai systems developed or used exclusively for military purposes\",\"however a digital form requiring manual input might be more accurate quicker to build and cheaper\",\"the benefits risks and harms discussed in this chapter are neither exhaustive nor applicable to every ai use case\",\"the appropriate security measures you should adopt depend on the level and type of risks that arise from specific processing activities\",\"have you enabled an open and transparent system to allow stakeholders to ask questions throughout the research process\",\"help control and monitor project specific or sensitive permissions\",\"you are not required to eliminate every risk identified\",\"have you shared your code for others to use and adapt\",\"for the development of potentially life saving ai systems it would be better to rely on other lawful bases\",\"equipped with high res still video and infrared cameras the drones are deployed to assess the steelwork wear and corrosion and faults such as damaged conductors\",\"as far as possible they will also seek to work with existing processes rather than creating new ones\",\"therefore implementing ai will require changes to an organisations software stack and possibly hardware that may introduce additional security risks\",\"at the same time guidance available before publication of this ai rmf does not comprehensively address many ai system risks\",\"it is also worth noting firms and fmis are expected to andor required to meet applicable operational resilience requirements and expectations irrespective of whether the ai is developed in house or by third parties\",\"whether you need to consult the ico\",\"developing all software components of an ai system from scratch requires a large investment of time and resources that many organisations cannot afford and especially compared to open source tools would not benefit from the rich ecosystem of contributors and services built up around existing frameworks\",\"the evaluation has not revealed particularly high or disproportionate costs and no substantial concerns have been raised regarding impacts on small and medium sized enterprises\",\"any platforms your team will use to collate the technology used across the ai project to help speed up ai deployment\",\"since new risks and compliance considerations may arise during the course of the deployment you should regularly review any outsourced services and be able to modify them or switch to another provider if their use is no longer compliant in your circumstances\",\"however you still need to comply with the main transparency requirements\",\"however avoiding overfitting will not completely eliminate the risks\",\"the constraint is that ml models need to be sufficiently small and computationally efficient to run on the users own hardware\",\"however this requirement should not be understood to cover manipulations of a technical nature which take place in the course of the transmission as such manipulations do not alter the integrity of the information transmitted\",\"whatever your approach you should ensure that your staff have appropriate skills and knowledge to address these security risks\",\"consult with your processor if you use one\",\"you may be able to buy your ai technology as an off the shelf product\",\"in most cases the design building and running of ai systems will be provided at least in part by third parties that you may not always have a contractual relationship with\",\"you should use our existing guidance on controllers and processors to help you with this\",\"whilst it may appear challenging in practice this may not be the case\",\"read our list of processing operations likely to result in high risk for examples of operations that require a dpia and further detail on which criteria are high risk in combination with others\",\"provide a reproducible environment for your teams to work from\",\"options may include recalibration impact mitigation or removal of the system from design development production or use as well as a range of compensating detective deterrent directive and recovery controls\",\"deciding if a consignment of goods undergoes border inspection\",\"if a proxy is identified designers developers and deployers should remove the proxy if needed it may be possible to identify alternative attributes that can be used instead\",\"you should integrate your ai systems development with your wider project phases\",\"the examples we have highlighted above are both black box attacks\",\"very few organisations build ai systems entirely in house\",\"each year  testers conduct  million mot tests in  garages across great britain\",\"when making this decision you should work with data scientists to consider whether your team has the skills to build an ai project in house\",\"this would need to be balanced against the need for genuine end users to know whether or not to rely on its output and will depend on the particular use case and context\",\"how have these been mitigated\",\"in particular iosco recommends the implementation of kill switch functionality in the control framework which is similar to the existing expectations and requirements for algorithmic trading in ss and commission delegated regulation eu\",\"however you might still be subjected to black box attacks\",\"there must be clear and open channels of communication between them and the project teams\",\"the national disabled law students association expressed concerns that individuals with disabilities were more likely to be flagged as potentially suspicious by remote proctoring ai systems because of their disability specific access needs such as needing longer breaks or using screen readers or dictation software\",\"however not all issues discussed will apply equally to each project using ai\",\"if you place more importance on finding as many of the positive cases as possible maximising recall this may come at the cost of some false positives lowering precision\",\"this may be partly a cultural issue and could lead to ineffective governance\",\"these harms rarely arise as a result of a deliberate choice most ai developers do not want to build biased or discriminatory applications or applications which invade users privacy\",\"you should monitor developments in these methods and assess whether they can provide meaningful data minimisation before attempting to implement them\",\"questionable design creators have not thoroughly considered technical issues related to algorithmic bias and safety risks\",\"aviation cars this proposal would not directly apply\",\"therefore it may sometimes be more appropriate to choose different lawful bases for your ai development and deployment\",\"you should assess the means that may be reasonably likely to be used in light of the vulnerabilities described above\",\"after deployment you should implement monitoring the frequency of which should be proportional to the impact an incorrect output may have on individuals\",\"the following hypothetical scenarios are intended to raise awareness of some of the known security risks and challenges that ai can exacerbate\",\"working in this way means you can launch new improvements without worrying about functionality once deployed\",\"making your algorithm accessible is not enough to make your research transparent\",\"this testing should follow domain specific best practices when available for ensuring the technology will work in its real world context\",\"you should not see dpias as simply a box ticking compliance exercise\",\"these harms rarely arise as a result of a deliberate choice most ai developers do not want to build biased or discriminatory applications or applications which invade users privacy\",\"consider available technical approaches to minimise the need for any trade offs\",\"this can create increased compliance costs for platforms operating cross border\",\"as this is a rapidly developing area you should stay up to date with the state of the art in both methods of attack and mitigation\",\"different technological approaches will either exacerbate or mitigate some of these issues but many others are much broader than the specific technology\",\"if firm a made the system available for use knowing that it was likely to cause serious harm they could be prosecuted for a criminal offence\",\"you should ensure that any system you procure aligns with what you consider to be the appropriate trade offs\",\"use cloud first when setting up your infrastructure\",\"however a digital form requiring manual input might be more accurate quicker to build and cheaper\",\"ai applications could be used in a way that excludes certain consumers\",\"undertaking this kind of exercise will require collaboration between different teams within the organisation\",\"only the largest companies can deal with the resulting compliance costs\",\"where ai systems are partly or wholly outsourced to external providers both you and any other organisations involved should also assess whether joint controllership exists under article  of the uk gdpr and if so collaborate in the dpia process as appropriate\",\"as explained in  what types of privacy attacks apply to ai models this could happen for two reasons by design or by accident\",\"youll need to investigate alternative mature technology solutions thoroughly to check if this is the case\",\"consider any techniques which you can implement with a reasonable level of investment and effort\",\"these safeguards cannot be token gestures\",\"however adversarial attacks dont necessarily involve unauthorised processing of personal data only a compromise to the system\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"AI security and 3rd

the definition be\",\"for instance the equalities and human rights commission has powers to provide guidance on equalities law while the competition and markets authority has powers related to consumer law and competition\",\"the proposal does not foresee the automatic creation of any additional bodies or authorities at member state level\",\"for example the competition and markets authority cma defines algorithmic systems as shorthand for an automated system at the intersection of algorithms data models processes objectives and people\",\"for example the equality of opportunity monitoring provision mentioned above cannot be relied on in such contexts because the processing is carried out for the purposes of decisions about a particular individual\",\"the framework is

legislation at the federal level\",\"for example the theory of differential privacy provides a framework for quantifying and minimising trade offs between the knowledge that can be gained from a dataset or statistical model and the privacy of the people in it\",\"while the treasury board may impose consequences for non compliance this is not the same as the broader enforcement powers under the aida\",\"first we outline the methodological approach taken for developing the comparative framework\",\"the minister would not have any influence on whether to prosecute an offence and the public prosecution service of canada would need to determine that a prosecution is in the public interest before it could proceed\",\"in terms of horizontal components it differentiates between unacceptable risk high risk limited risk minimal or no risk ai systems\",\"overall the aida would apply to persons including trusts joint ventures partnerships unincorporated associations and any other legal entities who carry out any of the regulated activities as specified above\",\"governance is designed to be a cross cutting function to inform and be infused throughout the other three functions\",\"a system awarding benefits changed its criteria invisibly\",\"in the context of this framework such domains are considered sensitive whether or not the specifics of a system context would necessitate coverage under existing law and domains and data that are considered sensitive are understood to change over time based on societal norms and context\",\"the definition should be based on the key functional characteristics of the software in particular the ability for a given set of human defined objectives to generate outputs such as content predictions recommendations or decisions which influence the environment with which the system interacts be it in a physical or digital dimension\",\"on the other hand the independence of these authorities should not mean that they cannot be subject in accordance with national constitutions and without endangering the achievement of the objectives of this regulation to national control or monitoring mechanisms regarding their financial expenditure or to judicial review or that they should not have the possibility to consult other national authorities including law enforcement authorities or crisis management authorities where appropriate\",\"however at this stage neither have passed through the house or senate and are not likely to come into force in the near future\",\"the most prevalent in the united states is the access boards section  regulations which are the technical standards for federal information communication technology software hardware and web\",\"map  targeted application scope is specified and documented based on the systems capability established context and ai system categorization\",\"the aida also exempts the federal government from its application\",\"the proposal sets a robust and flexible legal framework\",\"build a process based governance framework\",\"these governments were chosen for the first stage of this project for two related reasons\",\"the framework explicates how enforcement should be undertaken for non compliance for both institutions and individuals\",\"the minister would only have the ability to refer cases to the public prosecution service of canada which could choose at their discretion whether or not to proceed\",\"additionally the proposal does not amend sector specific legislation or the enforcement and governance mechanisms set thereunder but provides for a horizontal framework to rely on for aspects beyond specific content or subcategories of services regulated in sector specific acts\",\"indeed the bor explicitly states that it does not constitute binding guidance for the public or federal agencies and therefore does not require compliance while the principles of the bor also are non binding the bor provides guidance on how they can or in some cases already are enforced through federaland state level legislation within particular sectors\",\"it is not the responsibility of the machine or system to be considerate of these ideals\",\"the provider as a processor could still decide what programming languages and code libraries those tools are written in the configuration of storage solutions the graphical user interface and the cloud architecture\",\"that said as will be stressed below there are key differences in the way these decentralised approaches are enacted\",\"this specification of sectoral areas for high risk systems introduces a minor vertical component to the horizontal approach\",\"this is because complexity often corresponds to improved performance and use of ever greater volumes of data\",\"it also is not determinative of what the us governments position will be in any international negotiation\",\"it is important to distinguish between the terms algorithm and model as these have specific meanings within financial services regulation\",\"before turning to the comparative analysis based on the framework categories it is helpful to first provide an overview of the key aims of each jurisdictions approach and to briefly comment on their scope\",\"process based governance framework\",\"these frameworks have some features in common with the ai rmf\",\"a data science platform is a type of software tool which helps teams connect all of the technology they require across their project workflow speeding up ai deployment and increasing the transparency and oversight over ai models\",\"the framework is intended to be voluntary rights preserving non sector specific and use case agnostic providing flexibility to organizations of all sizes and in all sectors and throughout society to implement the approaches in the framework\",\"this framework does not prescribe profile templates allowing for flexibility in implementation\",\"such qualification should not extend however to ai systems intended for purely ancillary administrative activities that do not affect the actual administration of justice in individual cases such as anonymisation or pseudonymization of judicial decisions documents or data communication between personnel administratve tasks or allocations of resources\",\"each of these high level functions is broken down into categories and subcategories\",\"the ministers regulatory powers could not be used to investigate the criminal offences discussed in the next section which are true crimes that require criminal intent and are punishable by imprisonment\",\"in substance the resolutions are complementary in many aspects\",\"for example the definition of artificial intelligence systems in aida aligns with concepts developed through the oecd that are also represented in the eu ai act\",\"set of actionable principles\",\"title xi sets out rules for the exercise of delegation and implementing powers\",\"federal law has not grown to address the expanding scale of private data collection or of the ability of governments at all levels to access that data and leverage the means of private collection\",\"this decentralised sectoral approach is similar to the sectoral approach of the uk\",\"there are three elements to the legitimate interests lawful basis and it can help to think of these as the three part test\",\"this article focuses on the key distinctions between bill c  and bill c\",\"while the principles are non binding and horizontal the bor provides guidance on how they can be enforced by existing federaland state level sectoral legislation as well as federal agency led activities amongst others\",\"we define hard law as legally binding instruments eg primary and secondary legislation whereas soft law as non binding quasi legal instruments\",\"they include among others systems that predict a persons risk of committing a crime or that automate hiring decisions such as sorting resumes or cvs as defined in annex iii\",\"assuming a governance structure is in place functions may be performed in any order across the ai lifecycle as deemed to add value by a user of the framework\",\"both the eu and the canadian approach to risk entail horizontal risk frameworks with some vertical components\",\"despite these similarities there are notable differences between bills c  and c\",\"the framework is divided into two parts\",\"however some differ in their stringency\",\"in order to process it you need a lawful basis under article  as well as a separate condition under article  although these do not have to be linked\",\"build a process based governance framework\",\"these principles find kinship in the fair information practice principles fipps derived from the  report of an advisory committee to the us department of health education and welfare records computers and the rights of citizens\",\"in some circumstances application of these principles in whole or in part may not be appropriate given the intended use of automated systems to achieve government agency missions\",\"while the system does not directly use information about the applicants religion there might be features in the system which are indirect proxies for religion such as previous occupation or qualifications\",\"the alan turing institute calls these the fast track principles\",\"this means the provisions on automated decision making apply as a result a different range of available lawful bases may apply at the development and deployment stages\",\"title vi sets up the governance systems at union and national level\",\"this context is useful for understanding the rationale and trajectory of each governments approach yet it is beyond the scope of this report\",\"map  context is established and understood\",\"the fca mission sets out a framework for the way the fca takes these decisions and serves the public interest\",\"this is because these are distinct and separate purposes with different circumstances and risks\",\"thus this framework uses a two part test to determine what systems are in scope\",\"some of these measures conflict with each other meaning you cannot satisfy all of them at the same time\",\"bill c  never made it into law in part because a federal election was called in\",\"equal opportunities including but not limited toeducation related systems such as algorithms that purport to detect student cheating or plagiarism admissions algorithms online or virtual reality student monitoring systems projections of student progress or outcomes algorithms that determine access to resources or programs and surveillance of classes whether online or in personhousing related systems such as tenant screening algorithms automated valuation systems that estimate the value of homes used in mortgage underwriting or home insurance and automated valuations from online aggregator websites andemployment related systems such as workplace algorithms that inform all aspects of the terms and conditions of employment including but not limited to pay or promotion hiring or termination algorithms virtual or augmented reality workplace training programs and electronic workplace surveillance and management systems\",\"however we acknowledge that this inclusionexclusion criteria still creates some issues for instance the chances of some draft regulations being passed is higher than others eg\",\"many of the most popular ml development frameworks are open source\",\"however elements of the governance structure should be in place before then\",\"however where there are relevant differences between the requirements of the regimes these are explained in the
